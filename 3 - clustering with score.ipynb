ARMD is associated with the presence of drusen, without visual loss early in the disease, and often progresses to retinal atrophy and central retinal degeneration with associated loss of central vision. The intermediate form is associated with loss of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and the overlying retinal layers (atrophy), with loss of contrast sensitivity, loss of reading speed, and difficulty with adaptation to changing light conditions. The advanced, nonexudative form of ARMD is characterized by the presence of atrophy that can be associated with severe central visual-field loss. In all forms of dry ARMD, peripheral visual acuity is preserved. <a href=\"http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1226030-overview\">Exudative ARMD</a> is associated with the development of choroidal neovascular membranes that result in the development of exudate, subretinal fluid, and hemorrhage.</para>\\n        <para>Greater than 90% of patients diagnosed with ARMD have nonexudative (dry) ARMD; nonexudative ARMD is generally associated with much slower (over decades), progressive visual loss compared with exudative (wet) ARMD, which is generally associated with more rapid (over months) visual loss. However, patients with the more advanced cases of dry ARMD can have as profound a visual loss as those with exudative ARMD.</para>\\n        <para>ARMD describes a collection of inherited diseases (multifactorial) that share common features, including age predilection, positive family history, presence of yellow-gray material in the Bruch membrane (ie, drusen), RPE changes (eg, atrophy, clumping, RPE detachments) in the posterior pole or periphery, and visual disturbances (eg, abnormal reading, stereo and/or color vision disturbances, dark/light adaptation disturbances).</para>\\n        <para>RPE degeneration is accompanied by variable loss of both the overlying photoreceptors and the underlying choroidal perfusion. When the appropriate age and clinical findings are accompanied by the loss of visual acuity, visual field, or other visual functions, the condition is often classified as ARMD. At times, the step prior to the onset of visual loss has been classified as ARMD if the patient has characteristic drusen and relevant family history.</para>\\n        <para>ARMD usually manifests after age 50 years. The disease is often bilateral, and patients report a significant history of disease in family members who have lived to later years of their life. Many patients develop a more rapid form of visual loss secondary to the development of neovascularization from the choroid that develops either below or above the RPE; this form of ARMD is referred to as wet, while the more prevalent form is known as dry. When the dry form of ARMD progresses with larger areas of RPE atrophy, the condition is referred to as geographic atrophy (GA). GA usually is bilateral but not necessarily symmetrical.

A clinically useful guideline is when drusen in the posterior pole are greater than 5 in number and at least 63 µm in size. With time, drusen enlarge and result in shallow elevation of the RPE that overlies the Bruch membrane. These deposits may merge over time, and they can be associated with pigmentation change visible on ophthalmoscopy.</para>\\n        <para>Evaluation of the AREDS results provided a clinically useful method of determining risk of advanced ARMD by the use of simple criteria: (1) presence of large drusen (greater than 125 µm in size) and (2) the presence of pigment abnormalities. Thus, one eye having both large drusen and pigment abnormalities has a score of 2 (1 for each criterion), and if both eyes have each risk factor, the score is 4. Using this simplified criteria, the AREDS found that over 5 years, eyes with a risk factor score of 0 had only a 0.4% move to advanced ARMD, while those with 1 risk factor had a 3.1% move to advanced ARMD. However, when eyes had 2, 3, or 4 risk factors, the rate of advanced ARMD conversion (either large geographic atrophy or neovascularization) increased to 12%, 26%, and 47% respectively.<sup>[<ref_inline id=\"refsrc6\" name=\"refsrc6\" />6] </sup></para>\\n        <para>Because the above matrix is a simple and powerful tool to determine the persons who will develop advanced ARMD, it is useful to recollect the criteria when performing a clinical examination.

Nonexudative ARMD is characterized by the degeneration of the retina and the choroid in the posterior pole due to either atrophy or RPE detachment. The atrophy is generally preceded (or coincident in some cases) by the presence of yellow extracellular deposits adjacent to the basal surface of the RPE called drusen.</para>\\n        <para>Drusen are composed of vitronectin (a multifunctional plasma and extracellular matrix protein), lipids, immune and inflammatory related proteins, amyloid associated proteins, as well as other poorly characterized substances. While drusen were thought to be the result of accumulated waste material from subretinal tissues, data now suggest that the accumulation is due to the presence of inflammation in the subretinal space. This extracellular material in the Bruch membrane is composed of various substances, including vitronectin and proteinaceous material.</para>\\n        <para>The complement system is an alternative system (ie, independent of antibodies) of defense against infection. Complement factor H (CFH) is a robust anti-inflammatory agent, in that it protects host cells from complement-mediated damage by binding to the activated complement component C3b.</para>\\n        <para>In 2005, four separate groups reported that a common variation in the <em>CFH</em> (complement factor H) gene increased susceptibility to dry ARMD.</para>\\n        <para>In 2006, two other genes were identified that increased the risk similarly. The CFH polymorphism that was most significantly associated with ARMD is a T→C substitution that results in a tyrosine-to-histidine substitution of the CFH protein. Thus, it appears that in affected individuals, RPE cells may undergo damage via the complement system because of their inability to inhibit the complement cascade as effectively. Additional indirect evidence in support of this chain of events is noted by a publication that indicates that choroidal levels of C-reactive protein are elevated in homozygote CFH polymorphic individuals.<sup>[<ref_inline id=\"refsrc7\" name=\"refsrc7\" />7] </sup></para>\\n        <para>Some studies have dileneated a molecular pathway leading to geographic atrophy and visual loss. This pathway indicates that RPE death leads to secondary photoreceptor loss and consequent visual loss over time. Ambati et al found that RPE cells in patients with dry ARMD have low levels of a RNA-cleaving enzyme, DICER1. Low levels of this enzyme lead to decreased breakdown of RNA-Alu molecules. Overabundance of cytoplasmic RNA-Alu molecules (non-coding sequences of RNA) activates inflammatory proteins (NLRP3 inflammosome), which activates a cascade of molecular responses that lead to RPE cell death.<sup>[<ref_inline id=\"refsrc8\" name=\"refsrc8\" />8, <ref_inline id=\"refsrc9\" name=\"refsrc9\" />9] </sup></para>\\n      </pgroup>\\n    </sect2>\\n    <sect2 id=\"a7\">\\n      <title>Frequency</title>\\n      <pgroup>\\n        <title>United States</title>\\n        <para>Age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) is the leading cause of blindness in the United States for people older than 50 years.

A liberal definition of ARMD that includes all patients with significant drusen in the posterior pole, with or without visual loss, estimates the prevalence at greater than 20% of the population older than 60 years. A more rigorous, population-based survey with a definition that requires the presence of either late atrophy and/or choroidal neovascularization results in an incidence of 0% at age 50 years or younger, 2% at 70 years, and 6% at 80 years.

Patients likely will have steadily but slowly deteriorating visual acuity.

Variability of vision from day-to-day is common. </para>\\n          </listitem>\\n        </itemizedlist>\\n      </pgroup>\\n    </sect2>\\n    <sect2 id=\"e5\">\\n      <title>Patient Education</title>\\n      <pgroup>\\n        <para>See the list below:</para>\\n        <itemizedlist>\\n          <listitem>\\n            <para>Patients with geographic atrophy (GA) may have a variety of visual dysfunction. The location of atrophy often suggests the type of visual dysfunction that will be experienced by the patient. Many patients with age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) report difficulty in adjusting to changing light conditions; specifically, they take a significantly longer time to adjust to indoor lighting after being outside in bright sunlight. Wrap-around outdoor sunglasses that have an orange tint work for some patients. </para>\\n          </listitem>\\n          <listitem>\\n            <para>Patients who primarily have central atrophy often note trouble with reading and performing fine motor tasks.

These patients often can see 20/20, but they are unable to navigate due to the small area of good visual acuity. Some of these patients have to scan the screen to be able to see the 20/400 character. In these patients, excess magnification would be detrimental, because it would effectively decrease their limited visual field. Increased contrast and minification, by way of increased illumination and reverse telescopes respectively, may be beneficial for these patients. </para>\\n          </listitem>\\n          <listitem>\\n            <para>Referral to comprehensive vision rehabilitation is indicated early in the disease process. The American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) recommends referral for vision rehabilitation when acuity is less than 20/40 or when a loss of contrast sensitivity, scotoma, or field loss is noted. The aim of early referral is to prevent the many negative consequences of vision loss. For example, when acuity is reduced to 20/50 or worse, patients have twice the risk of falling, 3 times the risk of depression, and 4 or greater times the risk of hip fracture. Rehabilitation aims to maximize patients’ use of their partial vision and to provide practical adaptation to reduce disability. Comprehensive rehabilitation addresses the “whole person,” as outlined in the AAO’s booklet of <em>Vision Rehabilitation for Adults</em>. Barriers to low-vision therapy access include poor insurance coverage and transportation.<sup>[<ref_inline id=\"refsrc22\" name=\"refsrc22\" />22] </sup></para>\\n          </listitem>\\n          <listitem>\\n            <para>For patient education resources, see the <a href=\"http://www.emedicinehealth.com/collections/SU311.asp\">Eye and Vision Center</a>, as well as <a href=\"http://www.emedicinehealth.com/articles/14590-1.asp\">Macular Degeneration</a>.</para>\\n          </listitem>\\n        </itemizedlist>\\n      </pgroup>\\n    </sect2>\\n  </sect1>\\n  <mediasect>\\n    <title>start media</title>\\n    <query>\\n      <figure id=\"31032\">\\n        <title>A normal-appearing macula of the left eye.

      "Age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) is the most common cause of irreversible vision loss in the developed world. ARMD is associated with the presence of drusen, without visual loss early in the disease, and often progresses to retinal atrophy and central retinal degeneration with associated loss of central vision. The intermediate form is associated with loss of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and the overlying retinal layers (atrophy), with loss of contrast sensitivity, loss of reading speed, and difficulty with adaptation to changing light conditions. The advanced, nonexudative form of ARMD is characterized by the presence of atrophy that can be associated with severe central visual-field loss. In all forms of dry ARMD, peripheral visual acuity is preserved. Exudative ARMD is associated with the development of choroidal neovascular membranes that result in the development of exudate, subretinal fluid, and hemorrhage.\n",
      "Greater than 90% of patients diagnosed with ARMD have nonexudative (dry) ARMD; nonexudative ARMD is generally associated with much slower (over decades), progressive visual loss compared with exudative (wet) ARMD, which is generally associated with more rapid (over months) visual loss. However, patients with the more advanced cases of dry ARMD can have as profound a visual loss as those with exudative ARMD.\n",
      "ARMD describes a collection of inherited diseases (multifactorial) that share common features, including age predilection, positive family history, presence of yellow-gray material in the Bruch membrane (ie, drusen), RPE changes (eg, atrophy, clumping, RPE detachments) in the posterior pole or periphery, and visual disturbances (eg, abnormal reading, stereo and/or color vision disturbances, dark/light adaptation disturbances).\n",
      "RPE degeneration is accompanied by variable loss of both the overlying photoreceptors and the underlying choroidal perfusion. When the appropriate age and clinical findings are accompanied by the loss of visual acuity, visual field, or other visual functions, the condition is often classified as ARMD. At times, the step prior to the onset of visual loss has been classified as ARMD if the patient has characteristic drusen and relevant family history.\n",
      "ARMD usually manifests after age 50 years. The disease is often bilateral, and patients report a significant history of disease in family members who have lived to later years of their life. Many patients develop a more rapid form of visual loss secondary to the development of neovascularization from the choroid that develops either below or above the RPE; this form of ARMD is referred to as wet, while the more prevalent form is known as dry. When the dry form of ARMD progresses with larger areas of RPE atrophy, the condition is referred to as geographic atrophy (GA). GA usually is bilateral but not necessarily symmetrical. It can develop neovascularization and result in a more rapid loss of vision.\n",
      "Antioxidant multivitamin therapy (consisting of vitamin A at 25,000 IU, vitamin C at 500 mg, zinc at 80 mg, copper at 2 mg, and vitamin E at 400 mg) has been shown in a large clinical trail, the Age-Related Eye Diseases Study (AREDS), to be helpful in decreasing the risk of visual loss with nonexudative ARMD. Most of the decrease in visual loss appeared to be due to a reduced risk of conversion to wet ARMD. The AREDS notably did not show any benefit with the use of these vitamins in very early ARMD or in those subjects without ARMD at baseline.\n",
      "The Women's Antioxidant and Folic Acid Cardiovascular Study looked at a cohort of women without any evidence of ARMD. The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial included 5442 female healthcare professionals and noted that a combination of folic acid (2.5 mg/d), pyridoxine hydrochloride (50 mg/d), and cyanocobalamin (1 mg/d) reduced the relative risk of developing visually significant ARMD by approximately 40%. The study also demonstrated a reduced risk of developing nonvisually significant ARMD by a similar amount.[5] \n",
      "A phase I study demonstrated visual benefit and decreased progression of ARMD in subjects with advanced dry ARMD who were provided with an intravitreal implant that secreted ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF).\n",
      "Additional therapies that have been tried include rheopheresis (apheresis) and laser to drusen. While these therapies demonstrated a small benefit over the short term (1-3 y), they did not prove to have any significant benefit after that time. In fact, the Complications of Age-related Macular Degeneration Prevention Trial (CAPT) has demonstrated that laser to drusen is ultimately not beneficial and may potentially be harmful. \n",
      "The clinical definition of early age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) varies with the source consulted. A clinically useful guideline is when drusen in the posterior pole are greater than 5 in number and at least 63 µm in size. With time, drusen enlarge and result in shallow elevation of the RPE that overlies the Bruch membrane. These deposits may merge over time, and they can be associated with pigmentation change visible on ophthalmoscopy.\n",
      "Evaluation of the AREDS results provided a clinically useful method of determining risk of advanced ARMD by the use of simple criteria: (1) presence of large drusen (greater than 125 µm in size) and (2) the presence of pigment abnormalities. Thus, one eye having both large drusen and pigment abnormalities has a score of 2 (1 for each criterion), and if both eyes have each risk factor, the score is 4. Using this simplified criteria, the AREDS found that over 5 years, eyes with a risk factor score of 0 had only a 0.4% move to advanced ARMD, while those with 1 risk factor had a 3.1% move to advanced ARMD. However, when eyes had 2, 3, or 4 risk factors, the rate of advanced ARMD conversion (either large geographic atrophy or neovascularization) increased to 12%, 26%, and 47% respectively.[6] \n",
      "Because the above matrix is a simple and powerful tool to determine the persons who will develop advanced ARMD, it is useful to recollect the criteria when performing a clinical examination. For example, the presence of a large druse (125 µm in size) would be most easily remembered by looking for drusen whose shortest diameter is approximately 125 µm (or as large as the diameter of a retinal vein at the optic disc margin). Only drusen within 2 disc diameters of the center were used during the analysis. Pigment abnormalities included any areas of hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation, as well as noncentral areas of geographic atrophy.\n",
      "Visual acuity loss or visual-field loss occurs when the RPE atrophies and results in secondary loss of the overlying photoreceptor cells that it supplies. The variety of fundus changes described above defines dry ARMD. When the damaged RPE results in the development of choroidal neovascularization with late leakage on fluoresce in angiography and a decrease in vision and metamorphopsia, exudative (wet) ARMD is said to occur.\n",
      "Dry ARMD is an inherited autosomal dominant disease that appears to be affected by nutrition and environmental factors. Nonexudative ARMD is characterized by the degeneration of the retina and the choroid in the posterior pole due to either atrophy or RPE detachment. The atrophy is generally preceded (or coincident in some cases) by the presence of yellow extracellular deposits adjacent to the basal surface of the RPE called drusen.\n",
      "Drusen are composed of vitronectin (a multifunctional plasma and extracellular matrix protein), lipids, immune and inflammatory related proteins, amyloid associated proteins, as well as other poorly characterized substances. While drusen were thought to be the result of accumulated waste material from subretinal tissues, data now suggest that the accumulation is due to the presence of inflammation in the subretinal space. This extracellular material in the Bruch membrane is composed of various substances, including vitronectin and proteinaceous material.\n",
      "The complement system is an alternative system (ie, independent of antibodies) of defense against infection. Complement factor H (CFH) is a robust anti-inflammatory agent, in that it protects host cells from complement-mediated damage by binding to the activated complement component C3b.\n",
      "In 2005, four separate groups reported that a common variation in the CFH (complement factor H) gene increased susceptibility to dry ARMD.\n",
      "In 2006, two other genes were identified that increased the risk similarly. The CFH polymorphism that was most significantly associated with ARMD is a T→C substitution that results in a tyrosine-to-histidine substitution of the CFH protein. Thus, it appears that in affected individuals, RPE cells may undergo damage via the complement system because of their inability to inhibit the complement cascade as effectively. Additional indirect evidence in support of this chain of events is noted by a publication that indicates that choroidal levels of C-reactive protein are elevated in homozygote CFH polymorphic individuals.[7] \n",
      "Some studies have dileneated a molecular pathway leading to geographic atrophy and visual loss. This pathway indicates that RPE death leads to secondary photoreceptor loss and consequent visual loss over time. Ambati et al found that RPE cells in patients with dry ARMD have low levels of a RNA-cleaving enzyme, DICER1. Low levels of this enzyme lead to decreased breakdown of RNA-Alu molecules. Overabundance of cytoplasmic RNA-Alu molecules (non-coding sequences of RNA) activates inflammatory proteins (NLRP3 inflammosome), which activates a cascade of molecular responses that lead to RPE cell death.[8, 9] \n",
      "Age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) is the leading cause of blindness in the United States for people older than 50 years. The actual frequency of the disease depends on specific racial group studies. ARMD is more prevalent in whites and likely has a more severe course in patients who have light-colored eyes. A liberal definition of ARMD that includes all patients with significant drusen in the posterior pole, with or without visual loss, estimates the prevalence at greater than 20% of the population older than 60 years. A more rigorous, population-based survey with a definition that requires the presence of either late atrophy and/or choroidal neovascularization results in an incidence of 0% at age 50 years or younger, 2% at 70 years, and 6% at 80 years. In African Americans, dry ARMD is noted to be approximately half the incidence rate stated above.\n",
      "The incidence of age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) in Japanese and other Asian populations is lower than the white population in the United States, but reports suggest that the incidence is increasing. The Inuit people in Greenland have a significantly higher incidence, as well as a distinctive phenotype. Most black Africans and other people with darker-pigmented skin in general have a lower incidence of symptomatic macular degeneration. Similarly, it is evident that the lesions resulting from ARMD in Asian populations are different from those in white populations. This is in agreement with the most accepted theory regarding ARMD: that it is a multigenic inherited condition. The background and the specific gene affected would affect the phenotype. \n",
      "Age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) results in significant visual morbidity. The presence of neovascularization results in a blurry central visual field. Even in dry ARMD, with relatively good vision, patients often report trouble adjusting to varying light conditions. Often, these patients note difficulty when initially placed in a dark environment from a relatively lighted one (eg, entering a restaurant from bright sunlight).\n",
      "ARMD patients, especially those with the exudative variant, have a higher incidence of cerebrovascular accidents and cardiac disease.\n",
      "Geographic atrophy may also be associated with cognitive impairment, as assessed by mini-mental status exams and other similar tests. One case control study demonstrated a 3x increased odds for mild cognitive impairment in geographic atrophy subjects when compared to normal controls even when controlled for age, visual acuity and education level.[33] Additionally, 3000 subjects in the AREDS trial were subject to a battery of cognitive tests. Among subjects with ARMD, those with poorer vision had worse cognition.[10] Participants in the Cardiovascular Health Study underwent cognitive testing as well as mini-mental state testing and those with poorer cognition were at a slightly higher risk of having dry ARMD.[11] Given the higher rate of impaired cognitive function in patients with dry ARMD, it is important for the clinician to consider cognitive function when assessing low vision options and treatments.\n",
      "The incidence of age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) is higher in whites compared with African Americans. Some studies report a rate of approximately half in African West Indians in Barbados compared with whites in Baltimore, Maryland. The incidence in Asians is between the above 2 rates, although it appears that the incidence is increasing in this population.\n",
      "No known difference exists between males and females in the incidence of age-related macular degeneration (ARMD).\n",
      "As implied by its name, the incidence of age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) is related to the age of the patient. The incidence increases with each decade of life, with a significant rise in patients aged 70 years or older. \n",
      "Patients with age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) usually report a family history of decreased vision late in life.\n",
      "They often report difficulty with night vision and with changing light conditions. Specifically, patients report changes in Amsler grid self-evaluation and trouble with reading. \n",
      "Commonly, ARMD patients report visual fluctuation (ie, days when vision is poor and other days when it appears improved).\n",
      "Patients report difficulty with reading and making out faces.\n",
      "Metamorphopsia is not a major complaint, but it may be present as the atrophy slowly progresses.\n",
      "Funduscopic examination in age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) is significant for drusen in the early stages of disease. These drusen usually are confluent with significant pigment changes and accumulation of pigment in the posterior pole. RPE often appears atrophic with an easier visualization of the underlying choroidal plexus.\n",
      "In advanced stages of dry ARMD, these focal islands of atrophy coalesce and form large zones of atrophy with severely affected vision. \n",
      "Other signs of choroidal neovascularization include RPE elevation, exudate, or subretinal fluid. The presence of these symptoms may indicate that neovascularization is occurring and that fluorescein angiography may be indicated to evaluate the retina. \n",
      "The periphery of patients with ARMD often has areas of drusen, as well as RPE mottling and atrophy.\n",
      "Oxidative stress is believed to play a major role in the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) because of combined exposures of the retina to light and oxygen. Additionally, ARMD is now widely accepted as a genetically inherited disorder with late onset.\n",
      "Groundbreaking studies in the genetics of ARMD have changed the way in which most specialists perceive the disease. Specifically, a majority of the risk of developing ARMD is determined by variations in 3 specific genes, as follows:\n",
      "CFH gene (chromosome 1)\n",
      "BF (complement factor B) gene and C2 (complement component 2) gene (chromosome 6)\n",
      "LOC gene (chromosome 10)\n",
      "Maller and others showed that polymorphisms in the above 3 genes independently raise the risk of ARMD.[12] The above genetic factors contribute to approximately 50% of the sibling risk of developing ARMD.\n",
      "Smoking and a higher body mass index are 2 of the most common other environmental factors that contribute independently to the increase in the risk of developing ARMD. Smoking has been clearly identified as increasing the risk of ARMD by 2 times. \n",
      "Large studies have not shown hypertension or heart disease to increase the odds of developing ARMD.\n",
      "Serum lipids were extensively studied in regard to their relationship with ARMD in the National Eye Institute–sponsored AREDS. One report suggests dietary total omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LCPUFA) intake was inversely associated with the development of neovascular ARMD (although not nonexudative ARMD).[13] Similarly, individuals with higher fish consumption had a slightly lower incidence of developing neovascular ARMD. \n",
      "A study looking at whether the regular consumption of omega-3 fatty acids and fish may affect the onset of ARMD in women found that incidence of the disease was significantly decreased among women who ate 1 or more servings of fish per week.[14] \n",
      "Studying twins with ARMD, Seddon and others arrived at some interesting conclusions.[15] Current cigarette smoking increased the risk of developing ARMD by 1.9-fold, and past smoking still increased the risk by 1.7-fold. Increased consumption of fish (>2 servings of fish per week) and a higher intake of omega-3 fatty acids both were protective and reduced the odds of developing ARMD by 0.55-fold. \n",
      "These studies have generally been performed in individuals from the United States of European descent. Thus, the results may not apply to individuals of other races. \n",
      "See the list below:\n",
      "Fluorescein angiography is of value if the age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) patient notes a recent onset or worsening of vision associated with metamorphopsia. Metamorphopsia may indicate the onset of choroidal neovascularization. Clinical evidence for neovascularization includes retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) elevation, subretinal hemorrhage, and/or the presence of exudate. \n",
      "Fluorescein angiography, as shown in the images below, is performed by injecting 3 mL of 25% sodium fluorescein in a peripheral vein, followed by a rapid sequence of angiography images. Fluorescein is a vegetable-based dye that is activated by light at a particular wavelength, which causes emission at a higher wavelength. Using the appropriate blocking and transmission filters, the photographer is able to capture an image of the dye in the blood vessels and, later, as the dye leaks, images of the retina and the choroid. \n",
      "Some complications of fluorescein angiography may occur. The dye is relatively safe. Occasionally (< 5%), patients may have nausea or vomiting shortly after dye injection. Infrequently, patients may develop an allergic reaction to the dye and have hives, angioedema, venous dilation, and, very rarely, death (< 1/250,000). No cross-reactivity occurs between this dye and iodine. The dye is cleared by renal excretion and is safe in patients on dialysis. Note the images below. \n",

      "Dry age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) is followed best by accurate fundus photography, images of which are shown below.\n",
      "Performing tests (eg, fluorescein angiography) on a routine basis is not necessary.\n",
      "The physician is sometimes at a quandary when a patient describes loss of vision or new onset of metamorphopsia. The patient sometimes notes such changes as geographic atrophy (GA) progresses; unfortunately, it is almost impossible to discern these symptoms from the symptoms that occur when neovascularization has occurred. Therefore, a patient with a new onset of metamorphopsia or a sudden decrease in vision may require a fluorescein angiogram to distinguish exudative ARMD versus the indeterminable progression of GA. \n",
      "See the list below:\n",
      "Reports on age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) have examined the thickness of the retina with optical coherence tomography (OCT). This study has shown decreased reflectance at the level of the rod-cone layer indicating that atrophy is present in this layer. Note the images below. \n",
      "Multifocal electroretinography (MERG) may be performed on the retina to evaluate the functional response of rods and cones.\n",
      "The above 2 tests are not required in the evaluation of ARMD, but they have been performed by various authors to follow the progression of disease. \n",
      "See the list below:\n",
      "Amsler grid evaluation, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, and fluorescein angiography in age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) \n",
      "The cornerstone of evaluation of dry ARMD consists of visual acuity measurement and evaluation by Amsler grid. The biggest treatable risk of visual loss in dry ARMD is the development of neovascularization. Studies have shown Amsler grid evaluations, if performed properly, are quite sensitive in detecting change. The specificity of this test is somewhat limited. Patients with dry ARMD often note Amsler grid changes that are temporary, and good observers can detect progression of their dry ARMD on the grid. \n",
      "New metamorphopsia is a good indication for performing fluorescein angiography. This test is the most sensitive and specific way to evaluate for choroidal neovascularization. \n",
      "The earliest morphologic features of dry age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) consist of the accumulation of 2 kinds of lesions (ie, basal laminar deposits, basal linear deposits) just beneath the RPE layer. The accumulation of these deposits is often uneven and associated with RPE hyperplasia and migration. This condition is clinically evident as pigment clumping. As these deposits slowly increase, they can be seen as soft drusen and/or localized RPE detachments.\n",
      "As these drusen enlarge, they can cause the development of new blood vessels (wet ARMD) and/or the slow demise of the overlying photoreceptor cells. Photoreceptor cell loss can be accompanied by the thinning (atrophy) of RPE cells, as well as underlying choroidal circulation. The end stage of these changes is the presence of a very thin choroidal layer with the absence of small choroidal vessels underlying an area of atrophic RPE. The rod-cone layer overlying this zone is atrophied, and the middle retinal layers show signs of degeneration. This end stage gradually enlarges and is seen clinically as GA. \n",

      "Role of vitamins, antioxidants, risk of smoking, and hypertension[2, 3, 16, 4] \n",
      "Evidence shows that patients with early or moderate dry age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) should consume adequate quantities of antioxidants, including vitamin A, vitamin E, zinc, and lutein. Prevention is the best treatment in this case because no satisfactory method exists to treat dry ARMD. Accumulated evidence suggests that ARMD is a genetic disease. Therefore, children of patients who have lost vision to ARMD are the best candidates for a primary prevention trial. \n",
      "The first Age-Related Eye Diseases Study (AREDS) has concluded, and its results are illuminating. In this study, patients with very mild or moderate forms of dry ARMD were given antioxidant supplementation (15 mg of beta-carotene, 500 mg of vitamin C, 400 IU of vitamin E, 80 mg of zinc, plus 2 mg of copper). These patients had a small but definite decrease in their progression to advanced ARMD. Interestingly, the data showed benefit in preventing the conversion of dry ARMD to neovascular ARMD. \n",
      "A study by Millen et al examined the relationship between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) levels and the prevalence of ARMD.[17] The study determined that high concentrations of 25(OH)D protected against early ARMD in women younger than 75 years. \n",
      "The Rotterdam Study (1990–1993) investigated whether regular dietary intake of antioxidants was associated with a lower risk of developing ARMD in more than 4000 persons aged 55 years or older in The Netherlands. In this study, a high dietary intake of beta-carotene, vitamins C and E, and zinc was also associated with a substantially reduced risk of ARMD in elderly persons. \n",
      "Some evidence indicates that multivitamins with antioxidants and lutein may be of benefit. Clear evidence shows that smoking accelerates the disease process. It is recommended that patients who have a family history of ARMD, and specifically those patients whose first-degree relative has lost vision due to ARMD, should take a multivitamin with lutein each day. It is advised that patients stop smoking and consider supplemental oral antioxidants if they are unable to stop smoking. \n",
      "Controversy exists over the exact vitamin combination that may be beneficial. Zinc and vitamin E are commonly touted as providing the best benefits. One study reports the beneficial effects of zinc, while another study shows a worse outcome with large doses of zinc. Therefore, it would be prudent to take a multivitamin containing a moderate dose of these vitamins. \n",
      "To further refine the specific benefits of antioxidants, a randomized controlled clinical trial, Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2 (AREDS2), is currently underway. Its primary objective is to determine whether oral supplementation with macular xanthophylls (lutein at 10 mg/d plus zeaxanthin at 2 mg/d) or omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs; DHA plus eicosapentaenoic acid at a total of 1 g/d) will decrease the risk of progression to advanced ARMD, as compared with placebo. \n",
      "Observational epidemiologic studies indicate a direct association between homocysteine concentration in the blood and the risk of ARMD. The objective of the Women’s Antioxidant and Folic Acid Cardiovascular Study was to examine the incidence of ARMD in a trial of combined folic acid, pyridoxine hydrochloride, and cyanocobalamin.[5] The trial included 5442 female healthcare professionals aged 40 years or older with preexisting cardiovascular disease or 3 or more cardiovascular disease risk factors. The randomized trial data for the large cohort of women at high risk of cardiovascular disease indicated that daily supplementation with folic acid (2.5 mg/d), pyridoxine 50 mg/d) and cyanocobalamin (1 mg/d) may reduce the risk of ARMD. \n",
      "No specific data are available on the combined benefits of an AREDS-supplemented diet with the use of the above vitamins. Therefore, awaiting the results of the AREDS2 study would be of benefit. \n",
      "The purpose of the Cardiovascular Health and its Association with Prevalence and Progression of Age-Related Macular Degeneration (CHARM) study was to determine if cardiovascular health, as determined by novel noninvasive techniques, was associated with prevalent ARMD or ARMD progression.[18] The results were unexpected in that better cardiovascular health was associated with increased risk of prevalent ARMD and progression. Inconsistent findings between the prevalence and progression components could be due to truly different disease etiologies or to spurious findings, as can occur with inherent biases in case control studies of prevalence. Further investigation of these noninvasive methods of characterizing the cardiovascular system should be undertaken because they may help to further elucidate the role of the cardiovascular system in the etiology of prevalent ARMD and progression. \n",
      "Epidemiologic studies using a computer database previously indicated that the use of statins was protective against the development of ARMD. However, a 2007 study, using rigorous systems and graded macular photographs, confirmed that the use of statins was not correlated with ARMD incidence or progression.[19] \n",
      "Early symptoms \n",
      "Prolonged darkness (delayed dark adaptation) upon entering a restaurant from bright sunlight is one of the earliest symptoms, with patients noting this phenomenon prior to the presence of any significant atrophy. One effective suggestion for patients with this symptom is to use wrap-around shades. Some low-vision specialists suggest the use of orange-tinted, blue-blocker lenses. \n",
      "Patients with dry ARMD often have a visual function that is much poorer than suggested by their Snellen acuity. The presence of large areas of atrophy, usually in a perifoveal zone, results in large scotomas near the center of the visual field. These scotomas prevent patients from performing simple tasks (eg, recognizing faces, reading). Low-vision specialists often prescribe magnifiers with a line marker so that patients do not lose their place while reading. \n",
      "Family members of patients with ARMD \n",
      "While it would seem logical that the same vitamins used to treat patients with ARMD would be of benefit prior to the development of ARMD in family members, in the AREDS, supplements did not show any significant benefit with treatment over the 7-year follow-up when the disease was very mild. Additionally, many risks are associated with long-term zinc, vitamin A, and vitamin E supplementation. Instead, family members of patients with ARMD should do the following: \n",
      "Do not smoke and avoid second-hand smoke.\n",
      "Protect eyes from direct sunlight using either dark glasses or a wide-brimmed hat.\n",
      "Eat a well-balanced diet high in natural antioxidants.\n",
      "Eat fresh baked fish (1-2 servings) daily.\n",
      "Eat green leafy vegetables (eg, spinach, kale) daily.\n",
      "Consider a supplement consisting of folic acid (2.5 mg/d), pyridoxine (50 mg/d), and cyanocobalamin (1 mg/d).[5] \n",
      "Family members should be specifically requested NOT to take the AREDS supplement vitamins because the risk associated with long-term supplementation with these vitamins may not overcome the benefits of taking them. For example, in subjects with 1 risk factor in the AREDS, the race of progression of disease at 5 years was minimally different from that of the placebo-treated subjects. This also held true at 10 years. Subjects with more risk factors (2-4) had progressively increased levels of benefit with supplementation. \n",

Preliminary results indicate that focal laser therapy in a light grid pattern causes drusen resorption and improved visual acuity in the short term. However, the procedure was associated with a slightly higher risk of developing choroidal neovascularization in the short term compared with no laser treatment. Additionally, at the end of the study, no significant visual benefit was observed in those who were treated compared with those who did not receive laser treatment.\n",
      "More recently, a few patients underwent retinal translocation surgery during which the retina is rotated. Many of these patients developed accelerated dry macular degeneration with retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) atrophy at the site of the new macula. Interestingly, the area of atrophy that developed at the new site resembled almost identically the area of atrophy that was preexistent prior to the translocation. This provides clinical evidence that the RPE layer is source of disease pathophysiology and that the retinal atrophy that results is a response to diseased RPE.\n",
      "A phase II study using encapsulated, genetically modified cells that secrete ciliary neurotrophic factor indicated the retinal thickening occurred in a dose-dependent, statistically significant manner. Treated subjects also had a higher percentage of preserved vision. Additional studies are required prior to approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\n",
      "Isolated reports of both embryonic and adult-derived stem cells being placed in the subretinal space have been noted. These are small reports whose primary purpose was to determine the feasibility of such an endeavor. In the near future, RPE cell repair via external transplantation of stem cells may provide a reasonable method of treatment for those patients with severe disease. \n",
      "Serial general ophthalmologic examination, on a nonemergent basis, is indicated for patients with dry age-related macular degeneration (ARMD). If these patients have an acute loss of vision, retina consultation with fluorescein angiography is indicated in a timely manner to rule out the possibility of conversion to wet ARMD.\n",

      "Evidence suggests that diet plays an important role in the prevention of dry age-related macular degeneration (ARMD).[21] Epidemiologic studies suggest that a diet containing green leafy vegetables is of benefit. Smoking cessation is of significant benefit. Consumption of baked fresh fish also is beneficial, owing to the fatty acids provided; 1-2 servings a week are adequate. \n",
      "No limitations are noted for age-related macular degeneration (ARMD). Each state has specific visual-acuity criteria for driving with a private license.

      "See the list below:\n",
      "Prognosis for this disease is significantly better than the prognosis for wet age-related macular degeneration (ARMD). Patients likely will have steadily but slowly deteriorating visual acuity. It also is common to have other visual dysfunction (eg, loss of ability to quickly adapt to changing lighting conditions, loss of contrast sensitivity). Variability of vision from day-to-day is common. \n",
      "See the list below:\n",
      "Patients with geographic atrophy (GA) may have a variety of visual dysfunction. The location of atrophy often suggests the type of visual dysfunction that will be experienced by the patient. Many patients with age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) report difficulty in adjusting to changing light conditions; specifically, they take a significantly longer time to adjust to indoor lighting after being outside in bright sunlight. Wrap-around outdoor sunglasses that have an orange tint work for some patients. \n",
      "Patients who primarily have central atrophy often note trouble with reading and performing fine motor tasks. Magnification and increased contrast (via a monitor or increased illumination) are the best solutions for such visual dysfunction. \n",
      "In contrast, other patients have GA that spares the foveal center but affects the entire perifoveal region. These patients often can see 20/20, but they are unable to navigate due to the small area of good visual acuity. Some of these patients have to scan the screen to be able to see the 20/400 character. In these patients, excess magnification would be detrimental, because it would effectively decrease their limited visual field. Increased contrast and minification, by way of increased illumination and reverse telescopes respectively, may be beneficial for these patients. \n",
      "Referral to comprehensive vision rehabilitation is indicated early in the disease process. The American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) recommends referral for vision rehabilitation when acuity is less than 20/40 or when a loss of contrast sensitivity, scotoma, or field loss is noted. The aim of early referral is to prevent the many negative consequences of vision loss. For example, when acuity is reduced to 20/50 or worse, patients have twice the risk of falling, 3 times the risk of depression, and 4 or greater times the risk of hip fracture. Rehabilitation aims to maximize patients’ use of their partial vision and to provide practical adaptation to reduce disability. Comprehensive rehabilitation addresses the “whole person,” as outlined in the AAO’s booklet of Vision Rehabilitation for Adults. Barriers to low-vision therapy access include poor insurance coverage and transportation.[22] \n",

      "Atrial septal defect (ASD) is one of the more commonly recognized congenital cardiac anomalies presenting in adulthood. Atrial septal defect is characterized by a defect in the interatrial septum allowing pulmonary venous return from the left atrium to pass directly to the right atrium. Depending on the size of the defect, size of the shunt, and associated anomalies, this can result in a spectrum of disease from no significant cardiac sequelae to right-sided volume overload, pulmonary arterial hypertension, and even atrial arrhythmias.\n",
      "With the routine use of echocardiography, the incidence of atrial septal defect is increased compared to earlier incidence studies using catheterization, surgery, or autopsy for diagnosis.[1] The subtle physical examination findings and often minimal symptoms during the first 2-3 decades contribute to a delay in diagnosis until adulthood, the majority (more than 70%) of which is detected by the fifth decade. However, earlier intervention of most types of atrial septal defect is recommended.\n",
      "The 3 major types of atrial septal defect (ASD) account for 10% of all congenital heart disease and as much as 20-40% of congenital heart disease presenting in adulthood. The most common types of ASD include the following:\n",
      "Ostium secundum: The most common type of ASD accounting for 75% of all ASD cases, representing approximately 7% of all congenital cardiac defects and 30-40% of all congenital heart disease in patients older than 40 years. \n",
      "Ostium primum: The second most common type of ASD accounts for 15-20% of all ASDs. Primum ASD is a form of atrioventricular septal defect and is commonly associated with mitral valve abnormalities. \n",
      "Sinus venosus: The least common of the three, sinus venosus (SV) ASD is seen in 5-10% of all ASDs. The defect is located along the superior aspect of the atrial septum. Anomalous connection of the right-sided pulmonary veins is common and should be expected. Alternate imaging is generally required. \n",
      "Sex: ASD occurs with a female-to-male ratio of approximately 2:1. \n",
      "Age: Patients with ASD can be asymptomatic through infancy and childhood, though the timing of clinical presentation depends on the degree of left-to-right shunt. Symptoms become more common with advancing age. By the age of 40 years, 90% of untreated patients have symptoms of exertional dyspnea, fatigue, palpitation, sustained arrhythmia, or even evidence of heart failure. \n",
      "Atrial septal defect (ASD) is a congenital cardiac disorder caused by the spontaneous malformation of the interatrial septum.\n",
      "Ostium secundum ASD: This type of ASD results from incomplete adhesion between the flap valve associated with the foramen ovale and the septum secundum after birth. The patent foramen ovale usually results from abnormal resorption of the septum primum during the formation of the foramen secundum. Resorption in abnormal locations causes a fenestrated or netlike septum primum. Excessive resorption of the septum primum results in a short septum primum that does not close the foramen ovale. An abnormally large foramen ovale can occur as a result of defective development of the septum secundum. The normal septum primum does not close this type of abnormal foramen ovale at birth. A combination of excessive resorption of the septum primum and a large foramen ovale produces a large ostium secundum ASD. \n",
      "Ostium primum ASD: These defects are caused by incomplete fusion of septum primum with the endocardial cushion. The defect lies immediately adjacent to the atrioventricular (AV) valves, either of which may be deformed and incompetent. In most cases, only the anterior or septal leaflet of the mitral valve is displaced, and it is commonly cleft. The tricuspid valve is usually not involved. \n",
      "Sinus venosus ASD: Abnormal fusion between the embryologic sinus venosus and the atrium causes these defects. In most cases, the defect lies superior in the atrial septum near the entry of superior vena cava. Often there is associated anomalous drainage of the right superior pulmonary vein. The relatively uncommon inferior type is associated with partial anomalous drainage of the right inferior pulmonary vein. Anomalous drainage can be into the right atrium, the superior vena cava, or the inferior vena cava. \n",
      "Coronary sinus ASD: Coronary sinus defect is characterized by unroofed coronary sinus and persistent left superior vena cava that drains into the left atrium. A dilated coronary sinus often suggests this defect. This can result is desaturation due to right-to-left shunt into the left atrium. The diagnosis can be made by injecting contrast agent into left upper extremity; coronary sinus opacification precedes right atrial opacification. \n",
      "Atrial septal defect (ASD) may occur on a familial basis. Holt-Oram syndrome characterized by an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance and deformities of the upper limbs (most often, absent or hypoplastic radii) has been attributed to a single gene defect in TBX5.[2] The penetrance is nearly 100% for Holt-Oram syndrome. Approximately 40% of Holt-Oram cases are due to new mutations.\n",
      "Ellis van Creveld syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder associated with skeletal dysplasia characterized by short limbs, short ribs, postaxial polydactyly, dysplastic nails and teeth, and a common atrium, occurring in 60% of affected individuals.[3] \n",
      "Mutations in the cardiac transcription factor NKX2.5 have been attributed to the syndrome familial ASD associated with progressive atrioventricular block.[4] This syndrome is an autosomal dominant trait with a high degree of penetrance but no associated skeletal abnormalities. \n",
      "The magnitude of the left-to-right shunt across the ASD depends on the defect size, the relative compliance of the ventricles, and the relative resistance in both the pulmonary and systemic circulation. With small ASD, left atrial pressure may exceed right atrial pressure by several millimeters of mercury, whereas with large ASD, mean atrial pressures are nearly identical. Shunting across the interatrial septum is usually left-to-right and occurs predominantly in late ventricular systole and early diastole. Likely some augmentation occurs during atrial contraction. Note, however, that a transient and small right-to-left shunt can occur, especially during respiratory periods of decreasing intrathoracic pressure, even in the absence of pulmonary arterial hypertension.\n",
      "The chronic left-to-right shunt results in increased pulmonary blood flow and diastolic overload of the right ventricle. Resistance in the pulmonary vascular bed is commonly normal in children with ASD, and the volume load is usually well tolerated even though pulmonary blood flow may be more than 2 times systemic blood flow. Altered ventricular compliance with age can result in an increased left-to-right shunt contributing to symptoms. The chronic significant left-to-right shunt can alter the pulmonary vascular resistance leading to pulmonary arterial hypertension, even reversal of shunt and Eisenmenger syndrome.\n",
      "Because of an increase in plasma volume during pregnancy, shunt volume can increase, leading to symptoms. Pulmonary artery pressure usually remains normal.\n",
      "See the list below:\n",
      "The atrial septal defect (ASD) malformation can go undiagnosed for decades due to subtle physical examination findings and a lack of symptoms. \n",
      "Even isolated defects of moderate-to-large size may not cause symptoms in childhood. However, some may have symptoms of easy fatigability, recurrent respiratory infections, or exertional dyspnea. In childhood, the diagnosis is often considered after a heart murmur is detected on routine physical examination or after an abnormal finding is observed on chest radiographs or electrocardiogram (ECG). \n",
      "If undetected in childhood, symptoms can develop gradually over decades and are largely the result of changing compliance with age, pulmonary arterial hypertension, atrial arrhythmias, and, sometimes, those associated with mitral valve disease in a primum ASD. Virtually all patients with ASD who survive beyond the sixth decade are symptomatic. \n",
      "Clinical deterioration in older patients occurs by means of several mechanisms. \n",
      "First, an age-related decrease in left ventricular compliance augments the left-to-right shunt.\n",
      "Second, atrial arrhythmias, especially atrial fibrillation, but also atrial flutter or paroxysmal atrial tachycardia, increase in frequency after the fourth decade and can precipitate right ventricular failure. \n",
      "Third, most symptomatic adults older than 40 years have mild-to-moderate pulmonary arterial hypertension in the presence of a persistent large left-to-right shunt; therefore, the aging right ventricle is burdened by both pressure and volume overload. \n",
      "Another mechanism for symptoms particularly associated with primum ASD is related to clinically significant mitral regurgitation. Its incidence, extent, and degree of dysfunction increases with age. Mitral valve insufficiency leads to further increase in left atrial pressure and a higher degree of left-to-right shunt. \n",
      "Overall, the most common presenting symptoms include dyspnea, easy fatigability, palpitations, sustained atrial arrhythmia, syncope, stroke, and/or heart failure. \n",
      "In adults, one of the most common symptoms is the development of palpitations related to atrial arrhythmias.\n",
      "See the list below:\n",
      "The findings on physical examination depend on the degree of left-to-right shunt and its hemodynamic consequences, which, in turn, depends on the size of the defect, the diastolic properties of both ventricles, and the relative resistance of the pulmonary and systemic circulations. \n",
      "The patient can have a hyperdynamic right ventricular impulse due to increased diastolic filling and large stroke volume.\n",
      "Palpable pulsation of the pulmonary artery and an ejection click can be detected because of a dilated pulmonary artery.\n",
      "S1 is typically split, and the second component may be increased in intensity, reflecting forceful right ventricular contraction and delayed closure of the tricuspid leaflets. \n",
      "S2 is often widely split and fixed because of reduced respiratory variation due to delayed pulmonic valve closure (seen only if pulmonary artery pressure is normal and pulmonary vascular resistance is low). This characteristic abnormality is found in almost all patients with large left-to-right shunts. \n",
      "Blood flow across the ASD does not cause a murmur at the site of the shunt because no substantial pressure gradient exists between the atria. However, ASD with moderate-to-large left-to-right shunts result in increased right ventricular stroke volume across the pulmonary outflow tract creating a crescendo-decrescendo systolic ejection murmur. This murmur is heard in the second intercostal space at the upper left sternal border. \n",
      "Patients with large left-to-right shunts often have a rumbling middiastolic murmur at the lower left sternal border because of increased flow across the tricuspid valve. \n",
      "Auscultatory findings of the ASD may resemble those of mild valvular or infundibular pulmonic stenosis and idiopathic dilatation of the pulmonary artery. These disorders all manifest as a systolic ejection murmur, but they differ from the ASD by movement of the S2 with respiration, a pulmonary ejection click, or the absence of a tricuspid flow murmur. \n",
      "In patients with an ostium primum defect and an associated cleft of the mitral valve, an apical systolic regurgitant murmur of mitral regurgitation may be present. \n",
      "In patients who develop pulmonary arterial hypertension and right ventricular hypertrophy, a right ventricular S4 may be present. In such cases, the midsystolic pulmonic murmur is softer and shorter, the tricuspid flow murmur is not present, the splitting of S2 is narrowed with accentuated pulmonic component, and murmur of pulmonic regurgitation may become apparent. \n",
      "ASD is an acyanotic lesion. Thus, the patient should be normally saturated. In the rare case of severe pulmonary arterial hypertension, atrial shunt reversal (Eisenmenger syndrome) may occur, leading to cyanosis and clubbing. \n",
      "The decision to repair any kind of atrial septal defect (ASD) is based on clinical and echocardiographic information, including the size and location of the ASD, the magnitude and hemodynamic impact of the left-to-right shunt, and the presence and degree of pulmonary arterial hypertension. In general, elective closure is advised for all ASDs with evidence of right ventricular overload or with a clinically significant shunt (pulmonary flow [Qp]–to–systemic flow [Qs] ratio >1.5). Lack of symptoms is not a contraindication for repair.\n",
      "In childhood, spontaneous closure of secundum ASD may occur. However, in adulthood, spontaneous closure is unlikely. Patients may be monitored relatively conservatively for a period before intervention is advised. Considerations and even contraindications to consider no intervention include small size of the defect and shunt, severe pulmonary arterial hypertension, diagnosis during pregnancy (intervention can be deferred until after), severe left or right ventricular dysfunction. Guidelines for the management of adults with congenital heart disease have been recently updated.[5] \n",
      "For both children and adults, surgical mortality rates for uncomplicated secundum ASD are approximately 1-3%. Because of the lifetime risk associated with ASD, as outlined including paradoxical embolization, there should be ongoing evaluation and review of the indication and risks for closure, even for patients with small shunts. However, such closure remains controversial because patients with small defects generally have a good prognosis, and the risk of cardiopulmonary bypass may not be warranted. The widespread use of catheter closure of secundum ASD with lower mortality and without cardiopulmonary bypass has raised the question regarding the need to close even small defects. \n",
      "Long-term prevention of death and complications is best achieved when the ASD is closed before age 25 years and when the systolic pressure in the main pulmonary artery is less than 40 mm Hg. Even in elderly patients with large shunts, surgical closure can be performed at low risk and with good results in reducing symptoms.\n",
      "Either method of closure, whether transcatheter or surgical, results in excellent hemodynamic outcomes with no significant differences with regard to survival, functional capacity, atrial arrhythmias, or embolic neurologic events. However, atrial arrhythmia and neurologic events remain long-term risks particularly for patients with pre-existing events.[6] \n",
      "Closure of an atrial septal defect (ASD) is not recommended in patients with a clinically insignificant shunt (Qp-Qs ratio 0.7 or below) and in those who have severe pulmonary arterial hypertension or irreversible pulmonary vascular occlusive disease who have a reversed shunt with at-rest arterial oxygen saturations of less than 90%. In addition to the high surgical mortality and morbidity risk, closure of a defect in the latter situation may worsen the prognosis. Whether the patient whose condition is diagnosed well in the sixth decade of life would benefit from surgical closure remains controversial.\n",
      "See the list below:\n",
      "No specific laboratory blood tests are indicated in the workup of atrial septal defects (ASDs).\n",
      "Routine laboratory studies should be performed in patients undergoing intervention for ASD: \n",
      "Complete blood count\n",
      "Type and screen\n",
      "Metabolic profile or chemistry\n",
      "Coagulation studies (prothrombin time [PT] and activated partial thromboplastin time [aPTT])\n",
      "See the list below:\n",
      "Chest radiography \n",
      "In the presence of a clinically significant left-to-right shunt, chest radiographs most often show cardiomegaly because of dilatation of the right atrium and right ventricular chamber. \n",
      "The pulmonary artery is prominent, and pulmonary vascular markings are increased in the lung fields.\n",
      "Left atrial enlargement is rare only if clinically significant mitral regurgitation. On occasion, proximal dilatation of the superior vena cava can be seen in sinus venosus defect. \n",
      "Transthoracic echocardiography[1] \n",
      "An uncertain diagnosis can be clarified with transthoracic 2-dimensional echocardiography, which provides direct noninvasive visualization of most types of ASDs, including evaluation of the right atrium, right ventricle, and pulmonary arteries, as well as other associated abnormalities. The view most beneficial is often the subcostal view. One exception is the diagnosis of a sinus venosus defect, for which transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) may be needed to image the defect, but this still may not be able to visualize the pulmonary venous return. TEEs and an echocardiogram are shown below: \n",
      "In any patient with an ASD, particularly a sinus venosus defect, anomalies of systemic venous connection should be sought. These can be clearly identified by 2-dimensional imaging. Right atrial and right ventricular enlargement without identification of the cause should prompt consideration for a TEE. \n",
      "Doppler echocardiography may be helpful in demonstrating flow across the atrial septum. It typically shows a biphasic (systolic and diastolic) pattern with a small right-to-left shunt at the beginning of systole. \n",
      "Transthoracic echocardiography may be suboptimal in some patients with poor echocardiographic windows. In such patients, TEE can provide excellent definition of the atrial septum. TEE is also useful in guiding device placement during catheter ASD occlusion procedures and in providing immediate intraoperative assurance that defect closure is accomplished. \n",
      "Continuous-wave Doppler echocardiography is valuable for estimating right ventricular (and pulmonary arterial when there is no associated right ventricular outflow tract obstruction) systolic pressure when a tricuspid regurgitant jet is present. This technique is also useful in evaluating patients for obstruction to pulmonary venous return. \n",
      "Contrast echocardiography can provide additional confirmation. A right-to-left shunt can be detected by visualizing microcavitation bubbles in the left atrium and the left ventricle. A left-to-right shunt can be detected as a negative contrast washout effect in the right atrium. \n",
      "MRI: MRI has successfully been used to identify the size and position of ASD. However, utility is limited for small defects. A major advantage of MRI is the ability to quantify right ventricular size, volume, and function along with the ability to identify the systemic and pulmonary venous return. \n",
      "See the list below:\n",
      "Electrocardiography \n",
      "Characteristic findings in patients with secundum ASD are a normal sinus rhythm, right-axis deviation, and an rSR' pattern in V1, an interventricular conduction delay or right bundle branch block (which represents delayed posterobasal activation of the ventricular septum and enlargement of the right ventricular outflow tract). \n",
      "Left-axis deviation and an rSR' pattern in V1, an interventricular conduction delay or right bundle branch block suggests an ostium primum defect.\n",
      "Left-axis deviation and negative P wave in lead III suggest sinus venosus defect.\n",
      "Increasing pulmonary hypertension can cause loss of the rSR' pattern in V1 and a tall monophasic R wave with a deeply inverted T wave.\n",
      "A prolonged P-R interval can be seen in familial ASD or ostium primum secondary to left atrial enlargement and an increased distance for internodal conduction produced by the defect itself. Displacement of the AV node in a posteroinferior direction in some patients or an enlarged right atrium has also been reported. \n",
      "See the list below:\n",
      "When noninvasive techniques demonstrate the presence of an uncomplicated ASD in a child, routine cardiac catheterization for diagnosis is unnecessary. \n",
      "However, cardiac catheterization may be useful if the clinical data are inconsistent, if clinically significant pulmonary arterial hypertension is suspected, or if concurrent coronary artery disease must be assessed in patients older than 40 years. Catheterization is also a viable alternative for intervention for secundum ASD. \n",
      "The diagnosis of ASD may be confirmed by directly passing the catheter through the defect. \n",
      "Serial oxygen saturation measurements can be used to estimate the magnitude of the shunt\n",
      "In young patients, right heart pressures are often normal despite a large shunt.\n",
      "If high oxygen saturation is present in the superior vena cava or if the catheter enters a pulmonary vein directly from the right atrium, sinus venosus type is likely. \n",
      "Partial anomalous pulmonary venous return is usually associated with sinus venosus defect, but it may also accompany the ostium secundum type. \n",
      "Atrial septal defect (ASD) is a disorder to be addressed surgically or through interventional catheterization. No specific or definitive medical therapy is available. However, patients with significant volume overload or atrial arrhythmias may require specific drug therapy.\n",
      "The criterion standard in the treatment of atrial septal defect (ASD) is direct closure of the defect by using an open approach with extracorporeal support. John Gibbon performed the first successful ASD closure by applying this method in 1953. Surgical techniques and equipment have since improved to the point that the mortality rate from this repair approaches zero. \n",
      "In the usual procedure, a median sternotomy incision is made, and the sternum is split in the midline. Direct arterial and double venous (superior vena cava and inferior vena cava) cannulation are performed. By applying cardiopulmonary bypass, the aorta is clamped, and the heart is arrested with a cardioplegia solution. The caval snares are tightened, and the right atrium is opened. Most secundum defects can be closed by using a direct continuous suture of 3-0 or 4-0 polypropylene (Prolene). \n",
      "Caution must be taken when large defects are directly closed because this closure can distort the atrium. Large defects that rise superiorly can distort the aortic anulus if closed directly. These ASDs are best closed by using autologous pericardium or synthetic patches made of polyester polymer (Dacron) or polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). Care must be taken to completely remove any air or debris from the left atrium and ventricle before cardiopulmonary bypass is discontinued. Temporary pacing wires are left in place on the right ventricle before the chest is closed over the drains. \n",
      "In an ostium primum defect, surgical closure is more complicated. The patch must be attached to the septum at the juncture of the mitral and tricuspid valves. Mitral valve repair, including closure of the cleft mitral leaflet and, possibly annuloplasty, may be necessary to correct or prevent mitral insufficiency. In rare cases, mitral valve replacement may be required. \n",
      "In a sinus venosus defect, partial anomalous pulmonary venous return is typical. One or more of the pulmonary veins primarily drains into the right atrium. The ASD must be patched in such a way as to ensure that the anomalous pulmonary venous drainage is diverted into the left atrium. This patching may be simple or complex, depending on where the anomalous drainage enters. Many innovative techniques have been developed to redirect pulmonary venous flow, and the surgeon should be familiar with several approaches. Pulmonary venous return must not be compromised with the redirection because this invariably causes localized pulmonary venous hypertension. \n",
      "In recent years, minimally invasive approaches to the repair of ASD have garnered significant interest. In most cases, the size of the incision is simply decreased with different approaches to cardiopulmonary bypass. Examples include partial or full submammary skin incision, hemisternotomy, and limited thoracotomy. The goal is to improve better cosmetic results because these approaches are not associated with decreased morbidity or mortality. \n",
      "In recent times, secundum ASD have been closed by using a variety of catheter-implanted occlusion devices rather than by direct surgical closure with cardiopulmonary bypass. These devices are placed through a femoral venous approach and are deployed like an umbrella to seal the septal defect. These devices work best for centrally located secundum defects. Although surgical closure is associated with low morbidity and mortality and excellent long-term results, sternotomy and cardiopulmonary bypass are required.[7] \n",
      "Drs King and Mills performed the first transcatheter closure of a secundum ASD in the mid-1970s. William Rashkind pioneered the development of percutaneous ASD closure technique in late 1970s. Jim Lock developed the clamshell method in 1989. Around the same time, Sideris started clinical trials with buttoned device. \n",
      "Although many devices have been studied, over the last few years, 4 major devices have become available: CardioSEAL (NMT Medical, Inc; Boston, Mass), Amplatzer septal occluder (ASO) (AGA Medical Corporation; Golden Valley, Minn), HELEX septal occluder (Gore Medical [WL Gore & Associates, Inc]; Flagstaff, Ariz), and Sideris patch (Custom Medical Devices; Amarillo, Tex). The ASO is currently the most widely used device because it is easy to implant and allows closure of large orifices with excellent success rates in most cases. It was first used in humans in 1995. Selection of a particular device is difficult because no randomized trials have been conducted. Furthermore, devices are currently not amenable to percutaneous closure of ostium primum and sinus venosus defects. \n",
      "With this method, the static diameter of the defect is first assessed by using TEE. The diameter is then measured with a sizing balloon using the “stop-flow” technique to select the proper diameter of the device. Using this technique, the sizing balloon is inflated until no flow is visible through the defect using TEE. The margins of the orifice must be wide enough (≤5 mm) to accommodate the edges of the closing device. TEE has been the mainstream technique for device sizing, positioning, and deployment, but it can cause discomfort. In addition, airway protection and general anesthesia are required. Intracardiac echocardiography has been used for the same purpose. \n",
      "Transcatheter closure of ASDs is now established practice at most cardiac centers. It is proven safe in experienced hands, it is cost-effective, and it favorably compares to surgical closure with successful implantation rates of more than 96%. Transcatheter closure has been associated with fewer complications, shortened hospitalization, and reduced need for blood products. \n",
      "At any age, ASD closure is followed by symptomatic improvement and regression of positive airway pressure (PAP) and right ventricle size; however, the best outcome is achieved in patients with less functional impairment and less elevated PAP.[8] Considering the continuous increase in symptoms, right ventricle remodelling, and PAP with age, ASD closure must be recommended irrespective of symptoms early after diagnosis, even in adults of advanced age. \n",
      "Furthermore, transcatheter closure appears to have additional benefits regarding hemodynamic improvement compared with surgery. In one study, transcatheter closure with ASO improved the left atrial volume index, the left ventricular myocardial performance index, and the right ventricular myocardial performance index.[9] The last was unimpressive after surgery, possibly because of cardiopulmonary bypass. \n",
      "Another group compared atrial function in 45 patients with a mean age of 9 years after surgery and after percutaneous closure by using strain-rate imaging.[10] They found that both atrial functions were preserved after transcatheter closure, whereas the same was not seen after surgery. A potential explanation was that an atriotomy scar might have negatively influenced right atrial functio, whereas perioperative hypoxia or intraoperative myocardial damage might have altered the deformation properties of the left atrium. \n",
      "Postoperative management after atrial septal defect (ASD) repair is usually standard. Patients are expected to be awake and often extubated shortly after the operation. Drainage tubes are removed from the chest the first morning after surgery, and, except when rhythm problems occur, the pacing wires are removed shortly thereafter. Most patients can eat and ambulate without difficulty on the first or second postoperative day, and most are discharged by the third or fourth postoperative day. After transcatheter occlusion, patients are generally discharged the next day. Six months of treatment with aspirin with or without clopidogrel is recommended to prevent thrombus formation.\n",
      "Surgical follow-up care is maintained until the patient's wounds are completely healed and normal activities are resumed. This period rarely exceeds 1-2 months. All complications must be clearly resolved before the patient is discharged from surgical care. \n",
      "Obtain at least 1 follow-up echocardiogram to confirm complete closure of the ASD. A cardiologist with congenital experience should continue patient care to monitor for recurrence of the shunt and to ensure that the patient has returned to normal activities and cardiac function. For most patients, a yearly appointment after the immediate postoperative period is adequate, in large part to follow and evaluate for arrhythmia complications. \n",
      "For patient education resources, see Heart Center as well as Palpitations.\n",
      "Surgery may be associated with a long-term risk of atrial fibrillation or flutter. The risk of infective endocarditis exists during the first 6 months after surgery. The following complications are also associated with atrial septal defect (ASD):\n",
      "Congestive heart failure\n",
      "Arrhythmias\n",
      "\n",
      "Pulmonary hypertension\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Cyanosis\n",
      "\n",
      "Paradoxical embolization\n",
      "Stroke\n",
      "Infective endocarditis\n",
      "The following complications are specifically associated with the use of transcatheter occlusion devices:\n",
      "Device embolization and malpositioning: The incidence significantly varies among devices and is related to operator experience and appropriate case selection. With experienced clinicians, the incidence is less than 1%. Device embolization and malpositioning happens as a result of inadequate sizing of the defect or incorrect device placement. \n",
      "Postimplantation arrhythmias: The incidence is 1-4% and varies from first- to third-degree AV block and atrial fibrillation. These arrhythmias are usually short-lived and do not require medical treatment. Patients who develop complete heart block are typically hemodynamically stable and do not require pacing. The incidence of arrhythmia appears to be related to the size of the device. \n",
      "Thrombus formation: A study of 1000 patients was performed to investigate the incidence of thrombus by performing TEE at 4 weeks and 6 months after the procedure.[11] The overall incidence was 1.2%; 70% were found at 4 weeks. The lowest incidence was with ASO. Thromboembolic events were seen in 20% of patients with thrombus. In 80-85%, thrombus resolved with heparin and warfarin. Risk factors for thrombogenesis on the device were the type of device, postprocedural atrial fibrillation, incomplete neoendothelialization of the surface of the device, insufficient antithrombotic treatment, and previously undiagnosed hypercoagulability disorders (including aspirin resistance and persistent interatrial septal aneurysm). For prophylaxis, aspirin given for 6 months is a common practice. When combined with clopidogrel, no thrombus was noted at 4 weeks and 6 months in one study of 37 patients.[12] \n",
      "Cardiac perforation: The incidence is 0.1-0.4% for various devices. Oversizing of the device and deficient anterosuperior rims are risk factors for perforation. Technique-related perforation during the procedure is amenable to intervention. Device-related perforations occur after technically adequate procedure in approximately 70% of patients after hospital discharge. A retrospective review of 24 patients revealed that all presented with chest pain, shortness of breath, hemodynamic collapse, or sudden death. About 76% were female patients, and 70% of the perforations were late. If pericardial effusion is present on predischarge echocardiography, the patient should be hospitalized for 24-48 hours of observation and follow-up echocardiography.[13] \n",
      "Device erosion: Erosion of septal occluder devices occurs in 0.1-0.15% of implants.[14] Nearly all erosions occur at the dome of atria near the aortic root. Risk factors are a deficient aortic rim and/or superior rim and use of an oversized device. Aortic–right atrial fistula may be the consequence. Although device erosion is rare, the mortality rate is 10%. \n",
      "Increased levels of cardiac troponin I: Transcatheter closure induces minor myocardial lesions, the extent of which depends on the size of the ASO. The patient's age is not a factor.[15] \n",
      "Residual shunts: As many as 20% of patients may have a residual shunt persisting for 24 hours after the procedure; >90% of such residua are small. During follow-up, the incidence approaches 0% at 3 years for most series.[16, 17] \n",
      "Other complications include pericardial effusion, transient ischemic attack, and sudden death.\n",
      "Although life expectancy is not normal for patients with atrial septal defect (ASD), patients generally survive into adulthood without surgical or percutaneous intervention, and many patients live to advanced age. However, natural survival beyond age 40-50 years is less than 50%, and the attrition rate after 40 years of age is about 6% per year. Advanced pulmonary hypertension seldom occurs before the third decade. Late complications are stroke and atrial fibrillation. \n",
      "The mortality rate of surgical repair is less than 1% for patients younger than 45 years without heart failure and who have systolic pulmonary artery pressures less than 60 mm Hg. The morbidity rate is low. The surgical mortality rate increases with increasing age and pulmonary artery pressures. \n",
      "Surgical repair should be considered for all patients with uncomplicated ASDs with a clinically significant left-to-right shunt. Such repair is ideally completed at 2-4 years of age. Early surgical repair is considered in a few infants and young children with clinically significant symptoms or congestive heart failure (CHF).\n",
      "Surgery before the age 25 years results in a 30-year survival rate comparable to that of age- and sex-matched control subjects. However, at age 25-40 years, surgical survival is reduced, though not significantly if pulmonary artery pressures are normal. If pulmonary artery systolic pressure is higher than 40 mm Hg, late survival is 50% less than control rates, though life expectancy in surgically treated older patients is better than that of medically treated patients. Even in select patients older than 60 years with no serious comorbidities, ASDs should be closed as early as possible if an indication is present because surgery improves symptoms–at least in the short term–regardless of pulmonary artery pressure or functional class, as long as the left-to-right shunt remains large.\n",
      "Although surgical closure of ASDs in adulthood is associated with a significant mortality benefit, its benefit is limited in preventing atrial arrhythmias. The patient's age at the time of closure is the most important predictor of the development of atrial arrhythmia. \n",
      "Surgery for sinus venosus ASD is also associated with low morbidity and mortality, and postoperative subjective clinical improvement occurs irrespective of the patient's age at surgery. However, in contrast to ostium secundum ASD, surgery for sinus venosus defect is relatively complex and poses the risks of stenosis of the superior vena cava or pulmonary veins, residual shunting, and dysfunction of the sinoatrial node. \n",
      "In childhood, right ventricular dimensions decrease, often strikingly, after surgery. However, when adults undergo surgery, the dimensions remain abnormal in approximately 80% of patients. If right ventricular failure and tricuspid regurgitation are present before surgery, late postoperative right atrial and ventricular enlargement is typical, and right ventricular systolic function seldom normalizes. Patients in this situation improve, but they usually remain symptomatic, and their preoperative pulmonary vascular resistance influences their long-term outcome. \n",
      "A few patients who undergo surgical closure during childhood have late-onset supraventricular arrhythmias, which are believed to be related to patchy fibrosis of the right atrium secondary to dilatation and perhaps dysfunction of the sinus node. In adults, chronic preoperative atrial fibrillation usually persists after surgical repair, but cardioversion followed by antiarrhythmics treatment may be effective. If surgery is performed in patients older than 40 years, 50% of those with preoperative normal sinus rhythm have late postoperative atrial fibrillation. Intracardiac electrophysiologic studies have shown a high incidence of intrinsic dysfunction of the sinoatrial and AV nodes that persists after surgical repair. These nodal abnormalities are most common in the sinus venosus type than in the secundum type. \n",
      "Late events, including atrial fibrillation, stroke, and heart failure, are most common in patients undergoing repair in adulthood. This observation emphasizes the benefit of early repair of secundum ASDs in symptomatic patients. The unfavorable prognosis of late repairs is presumably related to long-standing deleterious effect of volume overload on the chambers on the right side, of pulmonary hypertension, and of right atrial enlargement with increased vulnerability to atrial arrhythmias and stroke. About 22% of late deaths are attributed to cerebrovascular events. Older age at repair and preoperative New York Heart Association class III or IV heart failure are independent predictors of late mortality. They are also predictive of atrial fibrillation, for which sinus node dysfunction with bradycardia-dependent atrial arrhythmias, scar-dependent multiple reentries, and atrial enlargement or atrial fibrosis due to increased pulmonary venous pressure with exercise are implicated as potential mechanisms.\n",
      "In a cohort of 300 minimally symptomatic patients at intervention with either surgical or transcatheter closure, long-term follow-up (median 10 years) shows maintained functional class, but continued arrhythmia risk associated with age at procedure and pre-existing arrhythmia. When controlling for these variables, there was a trend toward more arrhythmia in the surgical cohort. However, embolic events were more common in the transcatheter cohort.[6] \n",
      "See Treatment above.\n",
      "Common comorbidities include the following:\n",
      "Pulmonary hypertension \n",
      "Pulmonary hypertension (mean pulmonary artery pressure >20 mm Hg or systolic pulmonary artery pressure >50 mm Hg) occurs in 15-20% of patients with ASD. \n",
      "This condition is unusual in young patients, but it is observed in 50% of patients older than 40 years.\n",
      "In Eisenmenger syndrome—a late and rare complication of isolated secundum ASD that occurs in 5-15% of patients—extreme pulmonary obstruction may result in a reversal of the shunt of blood to a right-to-left flow. Desaturated blood entering the systemic circulation results in systemic hypoxemia and cyanosis. \n",
      "Right-sided heart failure \n",
      "Heart failure is due to the cardiac volume overload experienced on the right side of the heart because of left-to-right shunting.\n",
      "In patients of all ages, substantial relief of such a complication is generally observed after the defect is closed.\n",
      "Atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter\n",
      "These conditions are uncommon in young patients, though they are reported in as many as 50-60% of patients older than 40 years. Therefore, these arrhythmias occur most frequently with age, and they may become a major cause of morbidity and mortality. \n",
      "The use of anticoagulants is indicated in patients with atrial fibrillation because of the high risk of stroke. Although atrial fibrillation may be present in patients before surgery, surgery may also cause it. \n",
      "Stroke \n",
      "Regardless of their surgical status, 5-10% of patients have thromboembolic events (including stroke and transient ischemic attacks) on long-term follow-up.\n",
      "Even with small defects, paradoxical emboli may occur. Therefore, the presence of an ASD should be considered in any patient with a cerebral or other systemic embolus in whom no left-sided source is demonstrable. \n",
      "With increased experience over the years, transcatheter closure of suitable secundum atrial septal defects (ASDs) has now become preferable to surgical repair. Limitations currently include size and location of the defect. \n",
      "Perhaps the most innovative approach to surgical closure in many years was recently accomplished in the form of robotically assisted closure of ASD. Current technology allows for excellent visualization and magnification of internal anatomy, and the ability to perform surgery at a remote distance from the patient is now a reality. However, even with this amazing technology, today's devices will seem crude compared with future computer robots. Improved access and cardiopulmonary bypass technology will most likely make robotically assisted heart surgery a routine procedure in the near future. \n",

      "Myocardial infarction (MI) due to coronary artery disease is a leading cause of death in the United States, where more than 1 million people have acute myocardial infarctions (AMIs) each year.[1] \n",
      "The advent of coronary care units and early reperfusion therapy (lytic or percutaneous coronary intervention) has substantially decreased in-hospital mortality rates and has improved the outcome in survivors of the acute phase of MI. \n",
      "Complications of MI include arrhythmic, mechanical, and inflammatory (early pericarditis and post-MI syndrome) sequelae, as well as left ventricular mural thrombus (LVMT). In addition to these broad categories, right ventricular (RV) infarction and cardiogenic shock are other possible complications of acute MI. (See the image below.)\n",
      "For other discussions on myocardial infarction, see Myocardial Infarction, Right Ventricular Infarction, Imaging of Acute Myocardial Infarcts, and Use of Cardiac Markers in the Emergency Department.\n",
      "About 90% of patients who have an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) develop some form of cardiac arrhythmia during or immediately after the event. In 25% of patients, such rhythm abnormalities manifest within the first 24 hours. In this group of patients, the risk of serious arrhythmias, such as ventricular fibrillation, is greatest in the first hour and declines thereafter. The incidence of arrhythmia is higher with an ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and lower with a non–ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI).[2] \n",
      "The clinician must be aware of these arrhythmias, in addition to reperfusion strategies, and must treat those that require intervention to avoid exacerbation of ischemia and subsequent hemodynamic compromise. Most peri-infarct arrhythmias are benign and self-limited. However, those that result in hypotension, increase myocardial oxygen requirements, and/or predispose the patient to develop additional malignant ventricular arrhythmias should be aggressively monitored and treated. \n",
      "AMI is characterized by generalized autonomic dysfunction that results in enhanced automaticity of the myocardium and conduction system. Electrolyte imbalances (eg, hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia) and hypoxia further contribute to the development of cardiac arrhythmia. The damaged myocardium acts as substrate for re-entrant circuits, due to changes in tissue refractoriness. \n",
      "Enhanced efferent sympathetic activity, increased concentrations of circulating catecholamines, and local release of catecholamines from nerve endings in the heart muscle itself have been proposed to play roles in the development of peri-infarction arrhythmias. Furthermore, transmural infarction can interrupt afferent and efferent limbs of the sympathetic nervous system that innervates myocardium distal to the area of infarction. The net result of this autonomic imbalance is the promotion of arrhythmias. \n",
      "Peri-infarction arrhythmias can be broadly classified into the following categories:\n",
      "Supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, including sinus tachycardia, premature atrial contractions, paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, atrial flutter, and atrial fibrillation\n",
      "\n",
      "Accelerated junctional rhythms\n",
      "\n",
      "Bradyarrhythmias, including sinus bradycardia and junctional bradycardia\n",
      "Atrioventricular (AV) blocks, including first-degree AV block, second-degree AV block, and third-degree AV block\n",
      "Intraventricular blocks, including left anterior fascicular block, right bundle branch block (RBBB), and left bundle branch block (LBBB)\n",
      "Ventricular arrhythmias, including premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), accelerated idioventricular rhythm, ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation\n",
      "Reperfusion arrhythmias\n",
      "Sinus tachycardia is associated with enhanced sympathetic activity and can result in transient hypertension or hypotension. The elevated heart rate increases myocardial oxygen demand, and a decreased length of diastole compromises coronary flow, worsening myocardial ischemia. \n",
      "Causes of persistent sinus tachycardia include the following:\n",
      "Pain \n",
      "\n",
      "Anxiety\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Heart failure\n",

      "Pericarditis\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Pulmonary embolism\n",
      "\n",
      "In the setting of an AMI, sinus tachycardia must be identified, and appropriate treatment strategies must be devised. Treatment strategies include adequate pain medication, diuresis to manage heart failure, oxygenation, volume repletion for hypovolemia, administration of anti-inflammatory agents to treat pericarditis, and use of beta-blockers and/or nitroglycerin to relieve ischemia. \n",
      "Premature atrial contractions often occur before the development of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia, atrial flutter, or atrial fibrillation. The usual cause of these extra impulses is atrial distention due to increased left ventricular (LV) diastolic pressure or inflammation associated with pericarditis. \n",
      "No specific therapy is indicated. However, attention should be given to identifying the underlying disease process, particularly occult heart failure. \n",
      "The incidence of a paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia in the setting of an AMI is less than 10%. In the absence of definitive data in the patient with AMI, the consensus is that adenosine can be used when hypotension is not present. In patients without clinically significant LV failure, intravenous diltiazem or a beta-blocker can be used instead. In patients who develop severe heart failure or hypotension, synchronized electrical cardioversion is required. \n",
      "Atrial flutter occurs in less than 5% of patients with AMI. Atrial flutter is usually transient and results from sympathetic overstimulation of the atria. \n",
      "Treatment strategies for persistent atrial flutter are similar to those for atrial fibrillation, except that ventricular-rate control with drugs is less easily accomplished with atrial flutter than with atrial fibrillation. Therefore, synchronized electrical cardioversion (beginning with 50 J, or the biphasic equivalent) may be needed relatively promptly because of a decrease coronary blood flow and/or hemodynamic compromise. For patients whose atrial flutter is refractory to medical therapy, overdrive atrial pacing may be considered. \n",
      "The rate of atrial fibrillation is 10-15% among patients who have AMIs. The onset of atrial fibrillation in the first hours of AMI is usually caused by LV failure, ischemic injury to the atria, or RV infarction. Pericarditis and all conditions leading to elevated left atrial pressure can also lead to atrial fibrillation in association with an AMI. The presence of atrial fibrillation during an AMI is associated with an increased risk of mortality and stroke, particularly in patients who have anterior-wall MIs. \n",
      "Immediate electrical cardioversion is indicated for the patient in unstable condition, such as one with new or worsening ischemic pain and/or hypotension. Synchronized electrical cardioversion to treat atrial fibrillation begins with 200 J (or the biphasic equivalent). Conscious sedation (preferred) or general anesthesia is advisable prior to cardioversion. \n",
      "For patients in stable condition, controlling the ventricular response is the immediate objective. If the atrial fibrillation does not respond to cardioversion, IV amiodarone[3] or IV digoxin (in patients with LV dysfunction or heart failure) can be used to achieve ventricular rate control. \n",
      "For patients who do not develop hypotension, a beta-blocker can be used. For example, metoprolol may be given in 5-mg intravenous boluses every 5-10 min, with a maximum dose of 15 mg. Intravenous diltiazem is an alternative for slowing the ventricular rate, but it should be used with caution in patients with moderate-to-severe heart failure. In patients with new-onset sustained tachycardia (absent before MI), conversion to sinus rhythm should be considered as an option. \n",
      "Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter confer an increased risk of thromboembolism (see Deep Venous Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism). Therefore, anticoagulation with either unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) should be started if contraindications are absent. It is unclear whether anticoagulation is needed in cases of transient atrial fibrillation and how long after the onset of atrial fibrillation should the anticoagulation be started. \n",
      "An accelerated junctional rhythm results from increased automaticity of the junctional tissue that leads to a heart rate of 70-130 bpm. This type of dysrhythmia is most common in patients who develop inferior myocardial infarctions. Treatment is directed at correcting the underlying ischemia. \n",
      "Sinus bradycardia is a common arrhythmia in patients with inferior or posterior acute myocardial infarctions (AMIs). The highest incidence, 40%, is observed in the first 1-2 hours after AMI. \n",
      "The likely mechanism leading to bradycardia and hypotension is stimulation of cardiac vagal afferent receptors that result in efferent cholinergic stimulation of the heart. In the early phases of an AMI, resultant sinus bradycardia may actually be protective, reducing myocardial oxygen demand. Clinically significant bradycardia that decreases cardiac output and hypotension may result in ventricular arrhythmias and should, therefore, be treated aggressively. Isolated sinus bradycardia is not associated with an increase in the acute mortality risk, and therapy is typically unnecessary when the patient has no adverse signs or symptoms. \n",
      "When emergency therapy is indicated (eg, in a patient with a sinus rate of < 40 bpm with hypotension), atropine sulfate 0.5-1 mg may be given every 3-5 minutes to a maximum of 0.03-0.04 mg/kg. The inability to reverse hypotension with atropine in patients who develop sinus bradycardia and inferior MI suggests volume depletion and/or RV infarction. \n",
      "When atropine is ineffective and the patient is symptomatic or hypotensive, transcutaneous or transvenous pacing is indicated (see our main article on External Pacemakers). Denervate, transplanted hearts do not respond to atropine and, therefore, require cardiac pacing. \n",
      "If these interventions fail, additional pharmacologic intervention may be useful. Examples are dopamine 5-20 mcg/kg/min given intravenously, epinephrine 2-10 mcg/min, and/or dobutamine.\n",
      "Junctional bradycardia is a protective AV junctional escape rhythm at a rate of 35-60 bpm in patients who have an inferior MI. This arrhythmia is not usually associated with hemodynamic compromise, and treatment is typically not required. \n",
      "First-degree AV block is characterized by prolongation of the PR interval to longer than 0.20 seconds. This type of block occurs in approximately 15% of patients who have an acute myocardial infarction (AMI), most commonly an inferior infarction. Almost all patients who develop first-degree AV block have conduction disturbances above the His bundle. In these patients, the progression to complete heart block or ventricular asystole is rare. No specific therapy is indicated unless associated hemodynamic compromise is present. \n",
      "Calcium channel blockers and beta-blockers may cause or exacerbate a first-degree AV block, but they should be stopped only if hemodynamic impairment or a higher-degree block occurs. For a first-degree AV block associated with sinus bradycardia and hypotension, atropine should be administered. Continued cardiac monitoring is advisable in view of possible progression to higher degrees of block. \n",
      "Mobitz type I, or Wenckebach, AV block occurs in approximately 10% of patients who have an AMI and accounts for 90% of all patients who have an AMI and a second-degree AV block. A second-degree AV block is associated with a narrow QRS complex and is most commonly associated with an inferior MI. It does not affect the patient's overall prognosis. \n",
      "A Mobitz type I block does not necessarily require treatment. If the heart rate is inadequate for perfusion, immediate treatment with atropine 0.5-1 mg administered intravenously is indicated. Transcutaneous or temporary transvenous pacing is rarely required. \n",
      "A Mobitz type II AV block accounts for 10% of all second-degree AV blocks (overall rate of < 1% in the setting of AMI). A Mobitz type II block is characterized by a wide QRS complex, and it is almost always associated with anterior infarction. This type of block often progresses suddenly to a complete heart block. \n",
      "Mobitz type II AV blocks are associated with a poor prognosis, as the mortality rate associated with their progression to a complete heart block is approximately 80%. Therefore, this type of second-degree AV block should be immediately treated with transcutaneous pacing or atropine. Atropine helps in about 50% of cases, but it occasionally worsens the block with an increased heart rate. A temporary transvenous pacemaker, and possibly a permanent demand pacemaker, must ultimately be placed. \n",
      "A third-degree AV block (ie, a complete heart block), occurs in 5-15% of patients who have an AMI and may occur with anterior or inferior infarctions. In patients with inferior infarctions, this type of block usually develops gradually, progressing from first-degree or a type I second-degree block. In most patients, the level of the block is supranodal or intranodal, and the escape rhythm is usually stable with a narrow QRS and rates exceeding 40 bpm. In 30% of patients, the block is below the His bundle, where it results in an escape rhythm with a rate slower than 40 bpm and a wide QRS complex. \n",
      "Complete heart block in patients with an inferior MI usually responds to atropine. In most patients, it resolves within a few days without the need for a temporary or permanent pacemaker. The mortality rate for patients with inferior MI who develop complete heart block is approximately 15% unless a coexisting RV infarction is present, in which case the mortality rate is higher. \n",
      "Immediate treatment with atropine is indicated for patients with third-degree AV blocks. As with therapy for a Mobitz type II block, this treatment may not help and may sometimes worsen the block. Temporary transcutaneous or transvenous pacing is indicated for symptomatic patients whose condition is unresponsive to atropine. Permanent pacing should be considered in patients with persistent symptomatic bradycardia that remains unresolved with lysis or percutaneous coronary intervention. \n",
      "In patients with an anterior MI, an intraventricular block or a Mobitz type II AV block usually precedes a third-degree AV block. The third-degree block occurs suddenly and is associated with a high mortality rate. The Cardiac Arrhythmias and Risk Stratification After Myocardial Infarction (CARISMA) trial monitored patients with acute myocardial infarction and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction and found that high-degree atrioventricular block was the most powerful predictor of cardiac death.[4] Patients with these blocks typically have unstable escape rhythms with wide QRS complexes and at rates of less than 40 bpm. \n",
      "Immediate treatment with atropine and/or transcutaneous pacing is indicated. This is followed by temporary transvenous pacing. Patients with an anterior MI who develop a third-degree AV block and who survive to hospitalization often receive a permanent pacemaker. \n",
      "Conduction from the His bundle is transmitted through 3 fascicles: the anterior division of the left bundle, the posterior division of the left bundle, and the right bundle. An abnormality of electrical conduction in 1 or more of these fascicles is noted in about 15% of patients with AMI. Isolated left anterior fascicular block (LAFB) occurs in 3-5% of patients with AMI; progression to complete AV block is uncommon. Isolated left posterior fascicular block occurs in only 1-2% of patients who have an AMI. The blood supply of the posterior fascicle is larger than that of the anterior fascicle; therefore, a block here is associated with a relatively large infarct and high mortality rate.\n",
      "The right bundle branch receives its dominant blood supply from the left anterior descending (LAD) artery. Therefore, a new RBBB, which is seen in approximately 2% of patients with AMI, suggests a large infarct territory. However, progression to complete heart block is uncommon. In patients who develop an anterior MI and a new RBBB, the substantial risk for death is mostly from cardiogenic shock, which is presumably due to the large size of the myocardial infarct. \n",
      "The combination of RBBB with an LAFB is known as bifascicular block and commonly occurs with occlusion of the proximal LAD coronary artery. The risk of developing complete AV block is heightened, but complete block is still uncommon. Mortality is mostly related to the amount of muscle loss. Bifascicular block in the presence of first-degree AV block is called a trifascicular block. In 40% of patients, a trifascicular block progresses to a complete heart block. \n",
      "In the past, frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) were considered to represent warning arrhythmias and indicators of impending malignant ventricular arrhythmias. However, presumed warning arrhythmias are frequently observed in patients who have an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and who never develop ventricular fibrillation. On the converse, primary ventricular fibrillation often occurs without antecedent premature ventricular ectopy. \n",
      "For these reasons, prophylactic suppression of PVCs with antiarrhythmic drugs, such as lidocaine, is no longer recommended. Prophylaxis has been associated with an increased risk of fatal bradycardia or asystole because of the suppression of escape pacemakers. \n",
      "Given this evidence, most clinicians pursue a conservative course when PVCs are observed in a patient with an AMI, and they do not routinely administer prophylactic antiarrhythmics. Instead, attention should be directed toward correcting any electrolytic or metabolic abnormalities, plus identifying and treating recurrent ischemia. \n",
      "An accelerated idioventricular rhythm is seen in as many as 20% of patients who have an AMI. This pattern is defined as a ventricular rhythm characterized by a wide QRS complex with a regular escape rate faster than the atrial rate, but less than 100 bpm. AV dissociation is frequent. Slow, nonconducted P waves are seen; these are unrelated to the fast, wide QRS rhythm. \n",
      "Most episodes are short and terminate spontaneously. They occur with equal frequency in anterior and inferior infarctions. The mechanism might involve (1) the sinoatrial node or the AV node, which may sustain structural damage and depress nodal automaticity, and/or (2) an abnormal ectopic focus in the ventricle that takes over as the dominant pacemaker. \n",
      "The presence of accelerated idioventricular rhythm does not affect the patient's prognosis; no definitive evidence has shown that an untreated occurrence increases the incidence of ventricular fibrillation or death. This rhythm occurs somewhat more frequently in patients who develop early reperfusion than in others; however, it is neither sensitive nor specific as a marker of reperfusion. \n",
      "Temporary pacing is not indicated unless the rhythm is sustained and results in hypotension or ischemic symptoms. An accelerated idioventricular rhythm represents an appropriate escape rhythm. Suppression of this escape rhythm with an antiarrhythmic drug can result in clinically significant bradycardia or asystole. Therefore, an accelerated idioventricular rhythm should be left untreated. \n",
      "Nonsustained ventricular tachycardia is defined as 3 or more consecutive ventricular ectopic beats at a rate of greater than 100 bpm and lasting less than 30 seconds. In patients who experience multiple runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, the risk for sudden hemodynamic collapse may be substantial. \n",
      "Nonetheless, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia in the immediate peri-infarction period does not appear to be associated with an increased mortality risk, and no evidence suggests that antiarrhythmic treatment offers a morbidity or mortality benefit. However, nonsustained ventricular tachycardia occurring more than 48 hours after infarction in patients with LV systolic dysfunction (LV ejection fraction < 0.40) poses an increased risk for sudden cardiac death; electrophysiologic testing and appropriate therapy are indicated in these patients. \n",
      "Multiple episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia require intensified monitoring and attention to electrolyte imbalances. Serum potassium levels should be maintained above 4.5 mEq/L, and serum magnesium levels should be kept above 2.0 mEq/L. Ongoing ischemia should aggressively be sought and corrected if found. \n",
      "Sustained ventricular tachycardia is defined as 3 or more consecutive ventricular ectopic beats at a rate greater than 100 bpm and lasting longer than 30 seconds or causing hemodynamic compromise that requires intervention. Monomorphic ventricular tachycardia is most likely to be caused by a myocardial scar, whereas polymorphic ventricular tachycardia may be most responsive to measures directed against ischemia. Sustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia after an AMI is associated with a hospital mortality rate of 20%. \n",
      "Emergency treatment of sustained ventricular tachycardia is mandatory because of its hemodynamic effects and because it frequently deteriorates into ventricular fibrillation. Rapid polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (rate >150 bpm) associated with hemodynamic instability should be treated with immediate direct-current unsynchronized cardioversion of 200 J (or biphasic energy equivalent). Monomorphic ventricular tachycardia should be treated with a synchronized discharge of 100 J (or biphasic energy equivalent). \n",
      "If sustained ventricular tachycardia is well tolerated, antiarrhythmic therapy with amiodarone (drug of choice) or procainamide may be attempted before electrical cardioversion. Precipitating causes, such as electrolyte abnormalities, acid-base disturbances, hypoxia, or medication, should be sought and corrected. For persistent or recurrent ventricular tachycardia, overdrive pacing may be effective in electrically converting the patient's rhythm to a sinus rhythm. \n",
      "The incidence of primary ventricular fibrillation is greatest in the first hour after the onset of infarct (4.5%) and declines rapidly thereafter. Approximately 60% of episodes occur within 4 hours, and 80% occur within 12 hours. \n",
      "Secondary or late ventricular fibrillation occurring more than 48 hours after an MI is usually associated with pump failure and cardiogenic shock. Factors associated with an increased risk of secondary ventricular fibrillation are a large infarct, an intraventricular conduction delay, and an anteroseptal AMI. Secondary ventricular fibrillation in conjunction with cardiogenic shock is associated with an in-hospital mortality rate of 40-60%. \n",
      "Treatment for ventricular fibrillation is unsynchronized electrical countershock with at least 200-300 J (or biphasic energy equivalent) administered as rapidly as possible. Each minute after the onset of uncorrected ventricular fibrillation is associated a 10% decrease in the likelihood of survival. Restoration of synchronous cardiac electrical activity without the return of effective contraction (ie, electromechanical dissociation, or pulseless electrical activity) is generally due to extensive myocardial ischemia and/or necrosis or cardiac rupture. \n",
      "Antiarrhythmics, such as intravenous amiodarone and lidocaine, facilitate successful electrical defibrillation and help prevent recurrent or refractory episodes. After ventricular fibrillation is successfully converted, antiarrhythmic therapy is generally continued as a constant intravenous infusion for 12-24 hours. \n",
      "Prophylactic lidocaine reduces the incidence of ventricular fibrillation, but it is not used because it seems to be associated with an excessive mortality risk owing to bradycardic and asystolic events.[5] On the other hand, early use of beta-blockers in patients with AMI reduces the incidence of ventricular fibrillation as well as death.[6] \n",
      "In the past, the sudden onset of rhythm disturbances after thrombolytic therapy in patients with AMI was believed to be a marker of successful coronary reperfusion. However, a high incidence of identical rhythm disturbances is observed in patients with AMI in whom coronary reperfusion is unsuccessful. Therefore, these so-called reperfusion arrhythmias are neither sensitive nor specific for reperfusion and should be treated as discussed under Accelerated Idioventricular Rhythm in the Arrhythmic Complications: Ventricular Arrhythmias section above. \n",
      "The 3 major mechanical complications of AMI are ventricular free wall rupture (VFWR), ventricular septal rupture (VSR), and papillary muscle rupture with severe mitral regurgitation (MR). Each of these complications can result in cardiogenic shock. Clinical issues related to these mechanical problems are discussed below. (See also Myocardial Rupture.) \n",
      "VFWR is the most serious complication of AMI. VFWR is usually associated with large transmural infarctions and antecedent infarct expansion. It is the most common cause of death, second only to LV failure, and it accounts for 15-30% of the deaths associated with AMI. Incontrovertibly the most catastrophic of mechanical complications, VFWR leads to acute hemopericardium and death from cardiac tamponade. \n",
      "The overall incidence of VFWR ranges from 0.8-6.2%. The incidence of this complication has declined over the years with better 24 hour systolic blood pressure control; increased use of reperfusion therapy, beta blockers, and ACE inhibitors; and decreased use of heparin[7] . \n",
      "Data from the National Registry of Myocardial Infarction (NRMI) showed an elevated incidence of in-hospital mortality among patients who received thrombolytic therapy (12.1%) than among patients who did not (6.1%).[8] In the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction Phase II (TIMI II) trial, 16% of patients died from cardiac rupture within 18 hours of therapy.[9] Patients who underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) had an incidence of free wall rupture lower than that of patients receiving thrombolytic therapy. \n",
      "Risk factors for VFWR include advanced age greater than 70 years, female sex, no previous MIs, Q waves on ECG, hypertension during the initial phase of STEMI, corticosteroid or NSAID use, and fibrinolytic therapy more than 14 hours after STEMI onset. Patients with a history of angina pectoris, previous AMI, multivessel coronary disease, and chronic heart failure are less likely than others to develop VFWR of the LV because they develop collaterals and ischemic preconditioning.[8, 10, 11] \n",
      "VFWRs are dramatic; they present acutely or occasionally subacutely as pseudoaneurysms; and they most often involve the anterior or lateral wall of the LV. Most VFWRs occur within the first week after AMI. \n",
      "Becker et al classified the following 3 types of VFWRs[12] : \n",
      "Type I - an abrupt slitlike tear that is frequently associated with anterior infarcts and that occurs early (within 24 h)\n",
      "Type II - an erosion of infarcted myocardium at the border between the infarcted and viable myocardium\n",
      "Type III - an early aneurysm formation correlated with older and severely expanded infarcts\n",
      "Type III usually occurs later than type I or type II ruptures. Thrombolytic therapy accelerates the occurrence of cardiac rupture in Becker type I and type II VFWRs. In severely expanded infarctions (type III), thrombolytic therapy decreases the incidence of cardiac rupture. \n",
      "A pseudoaneurysm is formed when adjacent pericardium and hematoma seals off a myocardial rupture or perforation. The wall of a pseudoaneurysm is most often visualized as an aneurysmal outpouching that communicates with the LV cavity by means of a narrow neck. This wall is composed of pericardium and organized thrombus and/or hematoma. It is devoid of myocardial elements, whereas a true aneurysm has all the elements of the original myocardial wall and a relatively wide base. The pseudoaneurysm may vary in size and is at high risk of rupturing. \n",
      "Clinical presentations of VFWR vary depending on the acuity, location, and size of the rupture. Patients with acute VFWR present with severe chest pain, abrupt electromechanical dissociation or asystole, hemodynamic collapse, and possibly death. In about one third of the patients, the course is subacute, and they present with symptoms such as syncope, hypotension, shock, arrhythmia, and prolonged and recurrent chest pain. \n",
      "Early diagnosis of VFWRs and intervention are critical to patient survival. A high index of suspicion is required when patients with AMI present with severe chest pain, shock or arrhythmias, and abrupt development of electromechanical dissociation. ECG signs of impending VFWR have limited specificity but include sinus tachycardia, intraventricular conduction defect, and persistent or recurrent ST-segment elevation. \n",
      "Echocardiography is the diagnostic tool of choice. The key diagnostic finding is a moderate-to-large pericardial effusion with clinical and echocardiographic signs of impending pericardial tamponade. In patients with cardiac tamponade and electromechanical dissociation, moderate-to-severe pericardial effusion increases the mortality risk. Those patients without initial cardiac tamponade, while at a lower rate of mortality, should still be followed, as late rupture may still occur.[13] The absence of pericardial effusion on echocardiography has high negative predictive value. If the ability to obtain transthoracic echocardiograms is limited in patients receiving mechanical ventilation, transesophageal echocardiography can assist in confirming VFWR. \n",
      "MRI provides superior image quality and permits identification of the site and anatomy of a ventricular pseudoaneurysm (ie, ruptured LV restrained by the pericardium with enclosed clot). However, MRI is of limited use in the acute setting because of the time involved and nonportability of imaging units. \n",
      "The most important prevention strategy is early reperfusion therapy, with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) being the preferred modality. Fibrinolytic therapy is associated with overall decreased risk of VFWR; however, its use more than 14 hours after STEMI onset can increase the risk of early rupture.[14, 15] \n",
      "The standard treatment for VFWR is emergency surgical repair after hemodynamic stability is achieved. Patients may first need intravenous fluids, inotropic agents, and emergency pericardiocentesis. \n",
      "Pifarré and associates recommended the deployment of an intra-aortic balloon pump to decrease systolic afterload and improve diastolic myocardial perfusion.[16] \n",
      "Several surgical techniques have been applied, including infarctectomy, adhering with biologic glue patches made of polyethylene terephthalate polyester fiber (Dacron; DuPont, Wilmington, DE) or polytetrafluoroethylene fluoropolymer resin (Teflon; DuPont); and use of pledgeted sutures without infarctectomy. \n",
      "The mortality rate is significantly high and largely depends on the patient's preoperative hemodynamic status. Early diagnosis, rapid institution of the measures described above to achieve hemodynamic stability, and prompt surgical repair can improve survival rates. A follow-up to the Acorn randomized trial demonstrated long-term improvement in left ventricular structure and function after mitral valve surgery for as long as 5 years. These data provide evidence supporting mitral valve repair in combination with the Acorn CorCap device for patients with nonischemic heart failure with severe left ventricular dysfunction who have been medically optimized yet remain symptomatic with significant mitral regurgitation.[17] \n",
      "VSR is an infrequent but life-threatening complication of AMI. Despite optimal medical and surgical treatment, patients with VSR have a high in-hospital mortality rate. During the prethrombolytic era, VSRs occurred in 1-3% of individuals with MIs. The incidence declined with thrombolytic therapy (to 0.2-0.34%) because of improvements in reperfusion and myocardial salvage. The bimodal distribution of VSR is characterized by a high incidence in the first 24 hours, with another peak on days 3-5 and rarely more than 2 weeks after AMI. \n",
      "In patients receiving thrombolytics, the median time from the onset of symptoms of AMI to septal rupture was 1 day in the Global Utilization of Streptokinase and TPA [tissue plasminogen activator] for Occluded Coronary Arteries (GUSTO-I) trial[18] and 16 hours in the Should We Emergently Revascularize Occluded Coronaries for Cardiogenic Shock? (SHOCK) trial.[19] \n",
      "Risk factors for septal rupture include advanced age (>65 y), female sex, single-vessel disease, extensive MI, and poor septal collateral circulation.[20, 21] Before the advent of thrombolytics, hypertension and absence of a history of angina were risk factors for VSR. Extensive infarct size and RV involvement are other known risk factors for septal rupture.\n",
      "In patients with AMI without reperfusion, coagulation necrosis develops within 3-5 days after infarction. Neutrophils migrate to the necrotic zone and undergo apoptosis, release lytic enzymes, and hasten the disintegration of necrotic myocardium. Some patients have infarcts with large intramural hematomas, which dissect into the tissue and result in early septal rupture. The size of the septal rupture ranges from a few millimeters to several centimeters. \n",
      "VSR is categorized as simple or complex depending on its length, course, and location. In simple septal rupture, the perforation is at the same level on both sides of the septum, and a direct through-and-through communication is present across the septum. A complex septal rupture is characterized by extensive hemorrhage with irregular, serpiginous tracts in the necrotic tissue. \n",
      "Septal ruptures are most common in patients with large anterior MIs due to occlusion of the LAD artery causing extensive septal infarcts. These infarcts are associated with ST-segment elevations and Q waves in inferior leads (II, III, aVF) and these ECG changes are therefore more commonly seen in septal ruptures.[22] These ruptures are generally apical and simple.\n",
      "Septal ruptures in patients with inferior MI occur relatively infrequently. These ruptures involve the basal inferoposterior septum and are often complex. \n",
      "Symptoms of VSR complicating AMI include chest pain, shortness of breath, hypotension, biventricular failure, and shock within hours to days. Patients often present with a new, loud, and harsh holosystolic murmur. This murmur is loudest along the lower left sternal border and is associated with a palpable parasternal systolic thrill. RV and LV S3 gallops are common. \n",
      "In patients with cardiogenic shock complicating septal rupture, the murmur and thrill may be difficult to identify. In contrast, patients with acute MR often have a soft systolic murmur at the apex without a thrill. \n",
      "Echocardiography with color flow Doppler imaging is the diagnostic tool of choice for identifying a VSR. (See the image below.) Its sensitivity and specificity have been reported to be as high as 100%. In addition, it can be used for the following: \n",
      "Define the site and size of septal rupture\n",
      "Assess the LV and RV function\n",
      "Estimate the RV systolic pressure\n",
      "Quantify the left-to-right shunt\n",
      "Cardiac catheterization is usually required to confirm the diagnosis, quantitate the degree of left-to-right shunt, differentiate VSR from other conditions (eg, mitral regurgitation), plus visualize the coronary arteries.\n",
      "In patients with VSR, right-heart catheterization shows a step-up in oxygen saturation from the right atrium to the RV; in contrast, no step-up in oxygen saturation occurs among patients with MR. The presence of large V waves in the pulmonary capillary wedge tracing supports the diagnosis of severe acute MR. \n",
      "Left ventriculography can also be used to identify the site of ventricular rupture (see Cardiac Catheterization [Left Heart]). However, this study is usually unnecessary after a good-quality echocardiographic and Doppler examination is conducted.\n",
      "The key to management of VSR is prompt diagnosis and an aggressive approach to hemodynamic stabilization, angiography, and surgery. The optimal approach includes hemodynamic stabilization with the administration of oxygen and mechanical support with use of an intra-aortic balloon pump, as well as the administration of vasodilators (to reduce afterload and thus LV pressure and the left-to-right shunt), diuretics, and inotropic agents. \n",
      "Cardiac catheterization is needed to define the coronary anatomy; this is followed by urgent surgical repair.\n",
      "Medical therapy is intended only for temporary stabilization before surgery, as most patients' conditions deteriorate rapidly and they die in the absence of surgical intervention. In the GUSTO-I trial, the 30-day mortality rate was lower in patients with VSR who underwent surgical repair than in patients treated medically (47% vs 94%), as was the 1-year mortality rate (53% vs 97%).[18] Lemery et al reported a 30-day survival rate of 24% in patients treated medically compared with 47% in those treated surgically.[23] \n",
      "Current guidelines of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association for the treatment of patients with septal rupture complicating AMI highlight urgent surgical intervention, regardless of their clinical status.[24] Surgical management of septal rupture includes the following elements: \n",
      "Prompt establishment of hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass\n",
      "An approach to the septal rupture through the infarct area and the excision of all necrotic, friable margins of the septum and ventricular walls to avoid postoperative hemorrhage, residual septal defect, or both \n",
      "Reconstruction of the septum and ventricular walls by using prosthetic material and preservation of the geometric configuration of the ventricles and heart function \n",
      "Percutaneous closure of septal rupture is a relatively new approach, one used in select patients as an alternative to surgical repair or for the acute stabilization of critically ill patients. However, percutaneous closure is currently unavailable in many institutions, and no long-term outcome data are available. \n",
      "Several studies failed to show a relationship between perioperative mortality and concomitant coronary revascularization (coronary artery bypass grafting). Patients with cardiogenic shock due to septal rupture have the poorest outcome. In the SHOCK trial, the in-hospital mortality rate was higher in patients with cardiogenic shock due to septal rupture (87.3%) than in patients with cardiogenic shock from all other causes (59.2% with pure LV failure and 55.1% with acute MR).[19, 25] \n",
      "In patients who survive surgical repair, the rate of recurrent or residual septal defect is reported to be about 28%, and the associated mortality rate is high. \n",
      "Repeat surgical intervention is indicated in patients who have clinical heart failure or a pulmonary-systemic fraction greater than 2. \n",
      "MR is a common complication of AMI that results from local and global LV remodeling and that is an independent predictor of heart failure and death. MR typically occurs 7-10 days after an AMI, though this onset may vary according to the mechanism of MR. Papillary muscle rupture resulting in MR occurs within 1-14 days (median, 1 d). \n",
      "Mild-to-moderate MR is often clinically silent and detected on Doppler echocardiography performed during the early phase of AMI. In such cases, MR rarely causes hemodynamic compromise.\n",
      "Speckle tracking and 3-dimensional echocardiography proved to be important imaging tools in assessing reverse LV remodeling after degenerative mitral valve regurgitation surgery. Subtle regional preoperative changes in diastolic function of the septal and lateral wall could be preoperatively identified, aiding in optimizing the referral timing and recognizing potential culprits as indicators of disease recurrence after mitral repair.[26] \n",
      "Severe acute MR that results from the rupture of papillary muscles or chordae tendineae results in abrupt hemodynamic deterioration with cardiogenic shock. Rapid diagnosis, hemodynamic stabilization, and prompt surgical intervention are needed because acute severe MR is associated with a high mortality rate. \n",
      "The reported incidence of MR may vary because of several factors, including the diagnostic methods used, the presence or absence of heart failure, the degree of MR reported, the type of therapy rendered, and the time from infarct onset to testing. \n",
      "During the GUSTO-I trial, the incidence of MR in patients receiving thrombolytic therapy was 1.73%.[18] The SHOCK trial, which included MI patients presenting with cardiogenic shock, noted a 39.1% incidence of moderate to severe MR.[27] Kinn et al reported that reperfusion with angioplasty resulted in an 82% decrease in the rate of acute MR, as compared with thrombolytic therapy (0.31% vs 1.73%).[28] \n",
      "Risk factors for MR are advanced age, female sex, large infarct, previous AMI, recurrent ischemia, multivessel coronary artery disease, and heart failure. \n",
      "Several mechanisms can cause MR after AMI. Rupture of the papillary muscle is the most commonly reported mechanism.\n",
      "Such rupture occurs in 1% of patients with AMI and frequently involves the posteromedial papillary muscle rather than the anterolateral papillary muscle, as the former has a single blood supply versus the dual supply for the latter. Papillary muscle rupture may lead to flailing or prolapse of the leaflets, resulting in severe MR. Papillary muscle dysfunction due to scarring or recurrent ischemia may also lead to MR in the subacute and chronic phases after MI; this condition can resolve spontaneously. \n",
      "Large posterior infarctions produce acute MR due to asymmetric annular dilation and altered function and geometry of the papillary muscle. \n",
      "Patients with functional mild or moderate MR are often asymptomatic. The severity of symptoms varies depending on ventricular function. Clinical features of acute severe MR include shortness of breath, fatigue, a new apical holosystolic murmur, flash pulmonary edema, and shock. \n",
      "The new systolic murmur may be only early-to-mid systolic, not holosystolic. It may be soft or even absent because of the abrupt rise in left atrial pressure, which lessens the pressure gradient between the left atrium and the LV, as compared with chronic MR. The murmur is best heard at the apex rather than the lower left sternal border, and it is uncommonly associated with a thrill. S3 and S4 gallops are expected. \n",
      "The clinician cannot rely on a new holosystolic murmur to diagnose MR or assess its severity because of the variable hemodynamic status. In a patient with AMI who presents with a new apical systolic murmur, acute pulmonary edema, and cardiogenic shock, a high index of clinical suspicion for severe MR is the key to diagnosis. \n",
      "Chest radiography may show evidence of pulmonary edema in the acute setting without clinically significant cardiac enlargement.\n",
      "Echocardiography with color flow Doppler imaging is the standard diagnostic tool for detecting MR. Transthoracic echocardiography is the preferred initial screening tool, but transesophageal echocardiography is invaluable in defining the severity and exact mechanism of acute MR, especially when suspicion for papillary muscle rupture is high. Cardiac catheterization should be performed in all patients to determine the extent and severity of coronary artery disease. \n",
      "Determination of hemodynamic stability, elucidation of the exact mechanism of acute MR, and expedient therapy are all necessary for a favorable outcome. Medical management includes afterload reduction with the use of diuretics, sodium nitroprusside, and nitrates in patients who are not hypotensive. \n",
      "In patients who have hemodynamic compromise, intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation should be deployed rapidly. This intervention usually substantially reduces afterload and regurgitant volume, improving cardiac output in preparation for surgical repair. Without surgical repair, medical therapy alone in patients with papillary muscle rupture results in inadequate hemodynamic improvement and a poor short-term prognosis. \n",
      "Emergency surgical intervention is the treatment of choice for papillary muscle rupture. Surgical approaches may include mitral valve repair or replacement. In the absence of papillary muscle necrosis, mitral valve repair improves the survival rate more than mitral valve replacement does. This difference is because the subvalvular apparatus is usually preserved. Mitral valve repair also eliminates complications related to malfunction of the prosthesis. \n",
      "In patients with extensive necrosis of papillary muscle and/or ventricular free wall, mitral valve replacement is the preferred modality. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) performed at the time of surgery was shown in one study to improve short- and long-term survival.[29] \n",
      "The only situation in which emergency surgery can safely be avoided is in the case of intermittent MR due to recurrent ischemia. In these patients, successful myocardial revascularization may be effective. This procedure is accomplished by means of either angioplasty or coronary artery bypass grafting. \n",
      "Left ventricular aneurysm (LVA) is defined as a localized area of myocardium with abnormal outward bulging and deformation during both systole and diastole. The rate of LVAs after AMI is approximately 3-15%. Risk factors for LVA after AMI include female sex, total occlusion of the LAD artery, single-vessel disease, and absence of previous angina. \n",
      "More than 80% of LVAs affect the anterolateral wall; these are usually associated with total occlusion of the LAD. The posterior and inferior walls are less commonly affected. LVAs generally range from 1-8 cm. Histologically, LVAs are composed of fibrous scar that is notably thinned. This scar is clearly delineated from the adjacent ventricular muscle on microscopic examination. \n",
      "A history of MI and third or fourth heart sounds are common findings from the patient's history and physical examination.\n",
      "The chest radiograph may reveal an enlarged cardiac silhouette.\n",
      "Electrocardiography is characterized by ST elevation that persists several weeks after AMI and that appears in the same leads as those showing the acute infarct. Echocardiography is 93% sensitive and 94% specific for detection of LVA (see the image below), but cardiac catheterization remains the standard for establishing the diagnosis.\n",
      "Patients with small or clinically insignificant aneurysms can be treated conservatively with close follow-up. Medical therapy generally consists of the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, which reduce afterload, infarct extension, and LV remodeling. Anticoagulation is required when patients have severe LV dysfunction and/or thrombus in the LV or aneurysm. \n",
      "Surgical resection of the LVA is indicated if severe heart failure, ventricular tachyarrhythmias refractory to medical treatment, or recurrent thromboembolism is present. \n",
      "LVMT is a well-known complication of AMI and frequently develops after anterior infarcts of the LV wall. The incidence of LVMT as a complication of AMI ranges from 20-40% and may reach 60% in patients with large anterior-wall AMIs who are not treated with anticoagulant therapy. LVMT is associated with a high risk of systemic embolization. Anticoagulant therapy may substantially decrease the rate of embolic events by 33% compared with no anticoagulation. \n",
      "Factors contributing to LVMT formation include LV regional-wall akinesia or dyskinesia with blood stasis, injury to and inflammation of the endocardial tissue that provides a thrombogenic surface, and a hypercoagulable state. The most common clinical presentation of patients with LVMT complicating an MI is stroke. Most episodes occur within the first 10 days after AMI. Physical findings depend on the site of embolism. \n",
      "Transthoracic echocardiography remains the imaging modality of choice and is 92% sensitive and 88% specific for detecting LVMT (see the image below). Management of LVMT includes heparin treatment followed by oral warfarin therapy for 3-6 months. In patients with LVAs, lifelong anticoagulation may be appropriate if a mural clot persists.\n",
      "The incidence of early pericarditis after MI is approximately 10%, and this complication usually develops within 24-96. Pericarditis is caused by inflammation of pericardial tissue overlying infarcted myocardium. The clinical presentation may include severe chest pain, usually pleuritic, and pericardial friction rub. \n",
      "The key ECG change is diffuse ST-segment elevation in all or nearly all of leads. Echocardiography may reveal a small pericardial effusion. The mainstay of therapy usually includes aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Colchicine may be beneficial in patients with recurrent pericarditis. \n",
      "Before the era of reperfusion, the incidence of post-MI syndrome ranged from 1-5% after AMI, but this rate has dramatically declined with the advent of thrombolysis and coronary angioplasty. \n",
      "Although the exact mechanism has yet to be elucidated, post-MI syndrome is considered to be an autoimmune process. Clinical features include fever, chest pain, and other signs and symptoms of pericarditis occurring 2-3 weeks after AMI. Management involves hospitalization and observation for any evidence of cardiac tamponade. Treatment comprises rest, use of NSAIDs, and/or steroids in patients with recurrent post-MI syndrome with disabling symptoms.\n",
      "Despite the perception that patients with an acute MI admitted during off hours have higher rates of death compared to those admitted during regular hours, a multivariate analyses of outcomes data at the Mayo Clinic for weekends, nights, and holidays admissions of patients with acute MI who underwent percutaneous coronary interventions found no significant association for inpatient mortality, 30-day mortality, or 30-day readmissions, nor were there any differences in findings between those with or without ST-elevation MI (STEMI, non-STEMI).[30] However, the investigators did find a significant association between off-hour admissions of these patients with composite major complications as well as emergent coronary artery bypass graft surgery, ventricular arrhythmia, cerebrovascular events, and hemorrhage (gastrointestinal, retroperitoneal, intracranial). \n",

      "Heat illness may be viewed as a continuum of illnesses relating to the body's inability to cope with heat. It includes minor illnesses, such as heat edema, heat rash (ie, prickly heat), heat cramps, and tetany, as well as heat syncope and heat exhaustion. Heatstroke is the most severe form of the heat-related illnesses and is defined as a body temperature higher than 41.1°C (106°F) associated with neurologic dysfunction. \n",
      "Two forms of heatstroke exist. Exertional heatstroke (EHS) generally occurs in young individuals who engage in strenuous physical activity for a prolonged period of time in a hot environment. Classic nonexertional heatstroke (NEHS) more commonly affects sedentary elderly individuals, persons who are chronically ill, and very young persons. Classic NEHS occurs during environmental heat waves and is more common in areas that do not typically experience periods of prolonged hot weather. Both types of heatstroke are associated with high morbidity and mortality, especially when cooling therapy is delayed. \n",
      "With the influence of global warming, it is predicted that the incidence of heatstroke cases and fatalities will also become more prevalent. Behavioral responses are important in the management of temperature elevations and may provide clues to preventing the development of heatstroke.\n",
      "See Heat Illness: How To Cool Off Hyperthermic Patients, a Critical Images slideshow, for tips on treatment options for patients with heat-related illness. \n",
      "Despite wide variations in ambient temperatures, humans and other mammals can maintain a constant body temperature by balancing heat gain with heat loss. When heat gain overwhelms the body's mechanisms of heat loss, the body temperature rises, potentially leading to heatstroke. Excessive heat denatures proteins, destabilizes phospholipids and lipoproteins, and liquefies membrane lipids, leading to cardiovascular collapse, multiorgan failure, and, ultimately, death.\n",
      "The exact temperature at which cardiovascular collapse occurs varies among individuals because coexisting disease, drugs, and other factors may contribute to or delay organ dysfunction. Full recovery has been observed in patients with temperatures as high as 46°C, and death has occurred in patients with much lower temperatures. Temperatures exceeding 106°F or 41.1°C generally are catastrophic and require immediate aggressive therapy. \n",
      "Heat may be acquired by a number of different mechanisms. At rest, basal metabolic processes produce approximately 100 kcal of heat per hour or 1 kcal/kg/h. These reactions can raise the body temperature by 1.1°C/h if the heat-dissipating mechanisms are nonfunctional. Strenuous physical activity can increase heat production more than 10-fold, to levels exceeding 1000 kcal/h. Similarly, fever, shivering, tremors, convulsions, thyrotoxicosis, sepsis, sympathomimetic drugs, and many other conditions can increase heat production, thereby increasing body temperature. \n",
      "The body also can acquire heat from the environment through some of the same mechanisms involved in heat dissipation, including conduction, convection, and radiation. These mechanisms occur at the level of the skin and require a properly functioning skin surface, sweat glands, and autonomic nervous system, but they also may be manipulated by behavioral responses.\n",
      "Conduction refers to the transfer of heat between 2 surfaces with differing temperatures that are in direct contact. Convection refers to the transfer of heat between the body's surface and a gas or fluid with a differing temperature. Radiation refers to the transfer of heat in the form of electromagnetic waves between the body and its surroundings. The efficacy of radiation as a means of heat transfer depends on the position of the sun, the season, clouds, and other factors. For example, during summer, lying down in the sun can result in a heat gain of up to 150 kcal/h. \n",
      "Under normal physiologic conditions, heat gain is counteracted by a commensurate heat loss. This is orchestrated by the hypothalamus, which functions as a thermostat, guiding the body through mechanisms of heat production or heat dissipation, thereby maintaining the body temperature at a constant physiologic range.\n",
      "In a simplified model, thermosensors located in the skin, muscles, and spinal cord send information regarding the core body temperature to the anterior hypothalamus, where the information is processed and appropriate physiologic and behavioral responses are generated. Physiologic responses to heat include an increase in cardiac output and blood flow to the skin (as much as 8 L/min), which is the major heat-dissipating organ; dilatation of the peripheral venous system; and stimulation of the eccrine sweat glands to produce more sweat. \n",
      "As the major heat-dissipating organ, the skin can transfer heat to the environment through conduction, convection, radiation, and evaporation. Radiation is the most important mechanism of heat transfer at rest in temperate climates, accounting for 65% of heat dissipation, and it can be modulated by clothing. At high ambient temperatures, conduction becomes the least important of the 4 mechanisms, while evaporation, which refers to the conversion of a liquid to a gaseous phase, becomes the most effective mechanism of heat loss. \n",
      "The efficacy of evaporation as a mechanism of heat loss depends on the condition of the skin and sweat glands, the function of the lung, ambient temperature, humidity, air movement, and whether or not the person is acclimated to the high temperatures. For example, evaporation does not occur when the ambient humidity exceeds 75% and is less effective in individuals who are not acclimated. Nonacclimated individuals can only produce 1 L of sweat per hour, which only dispels 580 kcal of heat per hour, whereas acclimated individuals can produce 2-3 L of sweat per hour and can dissipate as much as 1740 kcal of heat per hour through evaporation. Acclimatization to hot environments usually occurs over 7-10 days and enables individuals to reduce the threshold at which sweating begins, increase sweat production, and increase the capacity of the sweat glands to reabsorb sweat sodium, thereby increasing the efficiency of heat dissipation. \n",
      "When heat gain exceeds heat loss, the body temperature rises. Classic heatstroke occurs in individuals who lack the capacity to modulate the environment (eg, infants, elderly individuals, individuals who are chronically ill). Furthermore, elderly persons and patients with diminished cardiovascular reserves are unable to generate and cope with the physiologic responses to heat stress and, therefore, are at risk of heatstroke. Patients with skin diseases and those taking medications that interfere with sweating also are at increased risk for heatstroke because they are unable to dissipate heat adequately. Additionally, the redistribution of blood flow to the periphery, coupled with the loss of fluids and electrolytes in sweat, place a tremendous burden on the heart, which ultimately may fail to maintain an adequate cardiac output, leading to additional morbidity and mortality. \n",
      "Factors that interfere with heat dissipation include an inadequate intravascular volume, cardiovascular dysfunction, and abnormal skin. Additionally, high ambient temperatures, high ambient humidity, and many drugs can interfere with heat dissipation, resulting in a major heat illness. Similarly, hypothalamic dysfunction may alter temperature regulation and may result in an unchecked rise in temperature and heat illness. \n",
      "On a cellular level, heat directly influences the body by interfering with cellular processes along with denaturing proteins and cellular membranes. In turn, an array of inflammatory cytokines, interleukins and heat shock proteins (HSPs) are produced. In particular, HSP-70 allows the cell to endure the stress of its environment. If the stress continues, the cell will succumb to the stress (apoptosis) and die.\n",
      "On a microvascular level, heat stroke resembles sepsis and involves inflammation, translocation of lipopolysaccharides from the gut, and activates the coagulation cascade. Certain preexisting factors, such as age, genetic makeup, and the nonacclimatized individual, may allow progression from heat stress to heatstroke, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS), and ultimately death. Progression to heatstroke may occur through thermoregulatory failure, an amplified acute-phase response, and alterations in the expression of HSPs.\n",
      "An index used by some, including the American College of Sports Medicine, is the Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT). It is an environmental heat stress index used to evaluate the risk of heat of heat-related illness on an individual. It is calculated using 3 parameters: temperature, humidity, and radiant heat. There is low risk if the WBGT is < 65ºF, moderate risk if it is between 65-73ºF, high risk if between 73-82ºF, and very high risk if >82ºF. \n",

      "In the United States, heat waves claim more lives each year than all other weather-related exposures combined (hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, and earthquakes).[1] According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 8,015 deaths were attributed to excessive heat exposure from 1979-2003, or an average of approximately 334 deaths per year.[2] \n",
      "Heatstroke and deaths from excessive heat exposure are more common during summers with prolonged heat waves. For example, during the heat wave of 1980 (a record year for heat), 1700 deaths were attributed to heat, compared to only 148 deaths attributed to heat the previous year. Persons older than 65 years accounted for at least 44% of cases. The numbers published by the NCHS are believed to grossly underestimate the true incidence of heat-related deaths because death rates from other causes (eg, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease) also increase during the summer, and especially during heat waves. \n",

      "Heatstroke is uncommon in subtropical climates. The condition is recognized increasingly in countries that experience heat waves rarely (eg, Japan), and it commonly affects people who undertake a pilgrimage to Mecca, especially pilgrims who come from a cold environment. In 1998, one of the worst heat waves to strike India in 50 years resulted in more than 2600 deaths in 10 weeks. Unofficial reports described the number of deaths as almost double that figure. \n",
      "Morbidity and mortality from heatstroke are related to the duration of the temperature elevation. When therapy is delayed, the mortality rate may be as high as 80%; however, with early diagnosis and immediate cooling, the mortality rate can be reduced to 10%. Mortality is highest among the elderly population, patients with preexisting disease, those confined to a bed, and those who are socially isolated. \n",
      "With the same risk factors and under the same environmental conditions, heatstroke affects all races equally. However, because of differences in social advantages, the annual death rate due to environmental conditions is more than 3 times higher in blacks than in whites.\n",
      "With the same risk factors and under the same environmental conditions, heatstroke affects both genders equally. However, because of gender differences in the workforce, the annual death rate due to environmental conditions is 2 times higher in men than in women. \n",
      "Infants, children, and elderly persons have a higher incidence of heatstroke than young, healthy adults. Infants and children are at risk for heat illness due to inefficient sweating, a higher metabolic rate, and their inability to care for themselves and control their environment. \n",
      "Elderly persons also are at increased risk for heat-related illnesses because of their limited cardiovascular reserves, preexisting illness, and use of many medications that may affect their volume status or sweating ability. In addition, elderly people who are unable to care for themselves are at increased risk for heatstroke, presumably because of their inability to control their environment. \n",
      "Exertional heat stroke (EHS) is a leading cause of injury and death in high school athletes; approximately two-thirds of such cases occur in August and involve football players, often those who are obese or overweight.[3] Lack of acclimatization is a major risk factor for EHS in young adults. \n",
      "Heatstroke is defined typically as hyperthermia exceeding 41°C and anhidrosis associated with an altered sensorium. However, when a patient is allowed to cool down prior to measurement of the temperature (as may occur during transportation in a cool ambulance or evaluation in an emergency department), the measured temperature may be much lower than 41°C, making the temperature criterion relative. Similarly, some patients may retain the ability to sweat, removing anhidrosis as a criterion for the diagnosis of heatstroke. Therefore, strict adherence to the definition is not advised because it may result in dangerous delays in diagnosis and therapy. \n",
      "Clinically, 2 forms of heatstroke are differentiated: classic, or nonexertional, heatstroke (NEHS) and exertional heatstroke (EHS). Classic heatstroke, which occurs during environmental heat waves, is more common in the very young and the elderly and should be suspected in children, elderly persons, and chronically ill individuals who present with an altered sensorium. Classic heatstroke occurs because of failure of the body's heat dissipating mechanisms. \n",
      "On the other hand, EHS affects young, healthy individuals who engage in strenuous physical activity, and EHS should be suspected in all such individuals who exhibit bizarre, irrational behavior or experience syncope. EHS results from increased heat production, which overwhelms the body's ability to dissipate heat.\n",
      "EHS is characterized by hyperthermia, diaphoresis, and an altered sensorium, which may manifest suddenly during extreme physical exertion in a hot environment. \n",
      "A number of symptoms (eg, abdominal and muscular cramping, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, dizziness, dyspnea, weakness) commonly precede the heatstroke and may remain unrecognized. Syncope and loss of consciousness also are observed commonly before the development of EHS. \n",
      "EHS commonly is observed in young, healthy individuals (eg, athletes, firefighters, military personnel) who, while engaging in strenuous physical activity, overwhelm their thermoregulatory system and become hyperthermic. Because their ability to sweat remains intact, patients with EHS are able to cool down after cessation of physical activity and may present for medical attention with temperatures well below 41°C. Despite education and preventive measures, EHS is still a leading cause of disability and death in high school athletes, particularly football players.[3] \n",
      "Risk factors that increase the likelihood of heat-related illnesses include a preceding viral infection, dehydration, fatigue, obesity, lack of sleep, poor physical fitness, and lack of acclimatization. Although lack of acclimatization is a risk factor for heatstroke, EHS also can occur in acclimatized individuals who are subjected to moderately intense exercise. EHS also may occur because of increased motor activity due to drug use, such as cocaine and amphetamines, and as a complication of status epilepticus. \n",
      "NEHS is characterized by hyperthermia, anhidrosis, and an altered sensorium, which develop suddenly after a period of prolonged elevations in ambient temperatures (ie, heat waves). Core body temperatures greater than 41°C are diagnostic, although heatstroke may occur with lower core body temperatures. \n",
      "Numerous central nervous system (CNS) symptoms, ranging from minor irritability to delusions, irrational behavior, hallucinations, and coma have been described. Other possible CNS symptoms include seizures, cranial nerve abnormalities, cerebellar dysfunction, and opisthotonos. \n",
      "Anhidrosis due to cessation of sweating is a late occurrence in heatstroke and may not be present when patients are examined.\n",
      "Patients with NEHS initially may exhibit a hyperdynamic circulatory state, but, in severe cases, hypodynamic states may be noted. \n",
      "Classic heatstroke most commonly occurs during episodes of prolonged elevations in ambient temperatures. It affects people who are unable to control their environment and water intake (eg, infants, elderly persons, individuals who are chronically ill), people with reduced cardiovascular reserve (eg, elderly persons, patients with chronic cardiovascular illnesses), and people with impaired sweating (eg, from skin disease or ingestion of anticholinergic or psychiatric drugs). In addition, infants have an immature thermoregulatory system, and elderly persons have impaired perception of changes in body and ambient temperatures and a decreased capacity to sweat.\n",
      "Temperature: Typically, the patient's temperature exceeds 41°C. However, in the presence of sweating, evaporating mechanisms, and the initiation of cooling methods, body temperatures lower than 41°C are common. \n",
      "Pulse: Tachycardia to rates exceeding 130 beats per minute is common.\n",
      "Blood pressure: Patients commonly are normotensive, with a wide pulse pressure; however, hypotension is common and may result from a number of factors, including vasodilation of the cutaneous vessels, pooling of the blood in the venous system, and dehydration. Hypotension also may be due to myocardial damage and may signal cardiovascular collapse. Blood pressure will usually correct with normalization of the body temperature. \n",
      "Symptoms of CNS dysfunction are present universally in persons with heatstroke. Symptoms may range from irritability to coma.\n",
      "Patients may present with delirium, confusion, delusions, convulsions, hallucinations, ataxia, tremors, dysarthria, and other cerebellar findings, as well as cranial nerve abnormalities and tonic and dystonic contractions of the muscles. Patients also may exhibit decerebrate posturing, decorticate posturing, or they may be limp. \n",
      "Coma also may be caused by electrolyte abnormalities, hypoglycemia, hepatic encephalopathy, uremic encephalopathy, and acute structural abnormalities, such as intracerebral hemorrhage due to trauma or coagulation disorders. \n",
      "Cerebral edema and herniation also may occur during the course of heatstroke.\n",
      "Examination of the eyes may reveal nystagmus and oculogyric episodes due to cerebellar injury. The pupils may be fixed, dilated, pinpoint, or normal. \n",
      "Heat stress places a tremendous burden on the heart. Patients with preexisting myocardial dysfunction do not tolerate heat stress for prolonged periods. \n",
      "Patients commonly exhibit a hyperdynamic state, with tachycardia, low systemic vascular resistance, and a high cardiac index. However, a hypodynamic state, with a high systemic vascular resistance and a low cardiac index, may occur in patients with preexisting cardiovascular disease and low intravascular volume. A hypodynamic state also may signal cardiovascular collapse. \n",
      "The central venous pressure generally is within the reference range or elevated unless the patient is severely volume depleted.\n",
      "High-output cardiac failure and low-output cardiac failure may occur.\n",
      "Patients with heatstroke commonly exhibit tachypnea and hyperventilation caused by direct CNS stimulation, acidosis, or hypoxia.\n",
      "Hypoxia and cyanosis may be due to a number of processes, including atelectasis, pulmonary infarction, aspiration pneumonia, and pulmonary edema. \n",
      "Gastrointestinal hemorrhage occurs frequently in patients with heatstroke. \n",
      "Patients commonly exhibit evidence of hepatic injury, including jaundice and elevated liver enzymes.\n",
      "Rarely, fulminant hepatic failure occurs, accompanied by encephalopathy, hypoglycemia, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and bleeding. \n",
      "Muscle tenderness and cramping are common; rhabdomyolysis is a common complication of EHS. The patient's muscles may be rigid or limp. \n",
      "Acute kidney injury is a common complication of heatstroke and may be due to hypovolemia, low cardiac output, and myoglobinuria (from rhabdomyolysis). Patients may exhibit oliguria and a change in the color of urine. \n",

      "Stimulant drugs, including cocaine and amphetamines, can generate excessive amounts of heat by increasing metabolism and motor activity through the stimulatory effects of dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine. The development of heatstroke in individuals intoxicated with stimulants is multifactorial and may involve a complex interaction between dopamine and serotonin in the hypothalamus and the brainstem. \n",
      "Neuroleptic agents also may elevate body temperature by increasing muscle activity, but, occasionally, these agents may cause neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS). NMS is an idiosyncratic reaction characterized by hyperthermia, altered mental status, muscle rigidity, and autonomic instability and appears to be due to excessive contraction of muscles. \n",
      "Certain drugs, such as inhaled volatile anesthetics and succinylcholine, may result in malignant hyperthermia. In contrast to heatstroke, malignant hyperthermia is believed to be induced by a decreased ability of the sarcoplasmic reticulum to retain calcium, resulting in sustained muscle contraction. \n",

Except for the mildest cases, patients diagnosed with exertional heatstroke (EHS) or nonexertional heatstroke (NEHS) should be admitted to the hospital for at least 48 hours to monitor for complications. \n",
      "Once heatstroke is suspected, cooling must begin immediately and must be continued during the patient's resuscitation. The American College of Sports Medicine recommends that cooling be initiated at the scene, before transporting the patient to an emergency department for further evaluation and treatment.[5] Despite extensive education and training, delays are still reported due to trepidation by athletic trainers to accurately diagnose and rapidly initiate treatment for EHS.[6] \n",

Rectal temperatures are still the preferred method of accurately obtaining core body temperatures.[7] \n",
      "Some studies have shown that promptly reducing the exposure time to excessive heat can dramatically improve long-term outcomes and decrease irreversible injury. If treatment is initiated within this so-called golden hour and is aggressive enough to rapidly reduce the core body temperature, complications (including multisystem organ failure) may be averted and the patient may have a much better prognosis.[8] \n",
      "In a review of 19 clinical trials and observational studies involving 556 patients, the conduction method of cooling was found to be more efficacious in young, active adults with EHS. Unfortunately, this review did not identify a preferred treatment found for NEHS, or a temperature endpoint to prevent overcooling.[9] \n",
      "Removal of restrictive clothing and spraying water on the body, covering the patient with ice water–soaked sheets, or placing ice packs in the axillae and groin may reduce the patient's temperature significantly. Patients who are unable to protect their airway should be intubated. Patients who are awake and responsive should receive supplemental oxygen.\n",
      "Intravenous lines may be placed in anticipation of fluid resuscitation and for the infusion of dextrose and thiamine if indicated. Hypoglycemia is a common occurrence in patients with EHS and may be a manifestation of liver failure; therefore, infusion of dextrose 50% in water solution (D50W) should be considered in all patients with heatstroke.\n",
      "Intensive care personnel must pay meticulous attention to the airway, reduce the temperature, limit the production of heat, optimize circulation, and monitor for and treat complications. Interventions to enable monitoring include the following: \n",
      "Insert a thermistor probe or temperature-sensing Foley catheter to monitor temperature continuously\n",
      "Insert a nasogastric tube to monitor for gastrointestinal bleeding and fluid losses\n",
      "Place a Foley catheter to monitor urine output and/or monitor body temperature\n",
      "The goal of treatment is to reduce the temperature by at least 0.2°C/min to approximately 39°C. Active external cooling generally is halted at 39°C to prevent overshooting, which can result in iatrogenic hypothermia. A flexible indwelling thermistor rectally or an esophageal probe can be placed to monitor core body temperature during treatment; alternatively, a more modern method is to use a temperature-sensing Foley catheter. Because thermal instability may persist for a few days after the onset of heatstroke, the temperature must be monitored continuously until it is stable. \n",
      "The optimal method of rapidly cooling patients has been a matter of debate for some time. A 2013 guideline from the Wilderness Medical Society recommends ice-water immersion as a superior method for rapidly lowering core body temperature below the critical levels normally found in heatstroke patients.[10] However, each method has its own theoretical advantages and disadvantages.\n",
      "Ice-water immersion or an equivalent method has the advantage of rapidly reducing core body temperature. Because of its high thermal conductivity, ice water can reduce core body temperature to less than 39°C in approximately 20-40 minutes.\n",
      "The disadvantages of ice-water immersion include the fact that it may be extremely uncomfortable for patients who are awake. In addition, in theory it can cause subcutaneous vasoconstriction, preventing the transfer of heat via conduction. Ice water also increases shivering, which in turn increases internal heat production. Other criticisms include difficulty monitoring and resuscitating patients while using this method. \n",
      "Evaporative heat loss, although perhaps less effective than immersion techniques, poses fewer practical difficulties. Evaporative body heat loss may be accomplished by removing all of the patient's clothes and intermittently spraying the patient's body with warm water while a powerful fan blows across the body, allowing the heat to evaporate. \n",
      "A number of other cooling techniques have been suggested, but none has proven superior to or equal to cold-water immersion or evaporative techniques. These include peritoneal, thoracic, rectal, and gastric lavage with ice water; cold intravenous fluids; cold humidified oxygen; cooling blankets; and wet towels. \n",
      "Cardiopulmonary bypass has been suggested for use in the most severe cases. However, this requires highly trained personnel and sophisticated equipment. \n",
      "Antipyretics (eg, acetaminophen, aspirin, other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) have no role in the treatment of heatstroke because antipyretics interrupt the change in the hypothalamic set point caused by pyrogens; they are not expected to work on a healthy hypothalamus that has been overloaded, as in the case of heatstroke. In this situation, antipyretics actually may be harmful in patients who develop hepatic, hematologic, and renal complications because they may aggravate bleeding tendencies. \n",
      "Dantrolene has been studied as a possible pharmacologic option in the treatment of hyperthermia and heatstroke. To date, however, it has not proved efficacious in clinical trials. \n",
      "Immediate administration of benzodiazepines is indicated in patients with agitation and shivering, to stop excessive production of heat. In addition, benzodiazepines are the sedatives of choice in patients with sympathomimetic-induced delirium as well as alcohol and sedative drug withdrawals. \n",
      "Neuroleptics (eg, chlorpromazine), which were the mainstays of therapy in the past, are best avoided because of their deleterious adverse effects, including lowering of the seizure threshold, interference with thermoregulation, anticholinergic properties, hypotension, hepatotoxicity, and other adverse effects. \n",
      "Benzodiazepines and, if necessary, barbiturates are the recommended agents for treatment of patients who are having convulsions. Barbiturates may be used despite their theoretical impedance of sweat production. \n",
      "Phenytoin is not effective in controlling convulsions in this situation. Patients whose convulsions are refractory to benzodiazepines and barbiturates should be paralyzed and provided mechanical ventilation. Electroencephalographic monitoring is recommended in all such patients, and anticonvulsant medications should be adjusted accordingly. \n",
      "Recommendations on the administration of intravenous fluids for circulatory support differ among patient populations and depend on the presence of hypovolemia, preexisting medical conditions, and preexisting cardiovascular disease. \n",
      "While patients with heatstroke invariably are volume depleted, cooling alone may improve hypotension and cardiac function by allowing blood to redistribute centrally. Aggressive fluid resuscitation generally is not recommended because it may lead to pulmonary edema. Cor pulmonale also is a common finding in patients with heatstroke. \n",
      "When pulse rate, blood pressure, and urine output do not provide adequate hemodynamic information, fluid administration should be guided by more invasive hemodynamic parameters, such as central venous pressure (CVP), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI), and cardiac index (CI) measurements. Patients who exhibit a hyperdynamic state (ie, high CI, low SVRI) generally respond to cooling and do not require large amounts of intravenous crystalloid infusions.\n",
      "Hypotensive patients who exhibit a hypodynamic response (ie, high CVP, low CI) traditionally have been treated with low-dose isoproterenol; however, its arrhythmogenicity has raised questions about its continued use. Dobutamine, which is less arrhythmogenic than isoproterenol and more cardioselective, may be the inotrope of choice in these patients. Alpha-adrenergic drugs generally are contraindicated because they cause vasoconstriction and may interfere with heat loss. \n",
      "The occurrence of rhabdomyolysis may be heralded by the development of dark, tea-colored urine and tender edematous muscles. Rhabdomyolysis releases large amounts of myoglobin, which can precipitate in the kidneys and result in acute kidney injury (AKI). Renal failure especially is common in patients who develop hypotension or shock during the course of their disease and may occur in as many as 25-30% of patients with EHS. \n",
      "Treatment of rhabdomyolysis involves infusion of large amounts of intravenous fluids (fluid requirements may be as high as 10 L), alkalinization of the urine, and infusion of mannitol. Fluid administration is best guided by invasive hemodynamic parameters, and urine output should be maintained at 3 ml/kg/h to minimize the risk of renal failure. \n",
      "Alkalinization of the urine (to a pH of 7.5-8.0) prevents the precipitation of myoglobin in the renal tubules and may control acidosis and hyperkalemia in acute massive muscle necrosis. Mannitol may improve renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate, increase urine output, and prevent fluid accumulation in the interstitial compartment (through its osmotic action). Mannitol also is a free radical scavenger and, therefore, may reduce damage caused by free radicals. Once renal failure occurs, dialysis is the only effective therapeutic modality for rhabdomyolysis. \n",
      "Muscle necrosis may occur so rapidly that hyperkalemia, hypocalcemia, and hyperphosphatemia become significant enough to cause cardiac arrhythmias and require immediate therapy. In the presence of renal failure, hemodialysis may be necessary.\n",
      "Hypertonic dextrose and sodium bicarbonate may be used to shift potassium into the intracellular environment while more definitive measures (eg, intestinal potassium binding, dialysis) are prepared. Use of insulin may not be necessary in patients who are not diabetic and may be deleterious for patients with EHS and patients with liver failure, who commonly develop hypoglycemia. \n",
      "Calcium should be used judiciously because it may precipitate in and cause additional muscle damage. Use of calcium is reserved for patients with ventricular ectopy, impending convulsions, or electrocardiographic evidence of hyperkalemia. \n",
      "Various other electrolyte abnormalities have been reported in patients with heatstroke and must be monitored closely and treated carefully. These abnormalities may be related to solute-altering conditions such as vomiting, diarrhea, and use of diuretics. For example, hypokalemia, which is common in the early phases of heatstroke, may develop in response to respiratory alkalosis, diarrhea, and sweating. Similarly, hyponatremia may be due to sodium losses and/or rehydration with salt-poor solutions (eg, water), and hypernatremia may be due to dehydration. \n",
      "Heatstroke commonly leads to severe but reversible hepatic damage. Hepatic injury is represented by elevations in transaminase levels and bilirubin. During this phase, hypoglycemia, abnormal coagulation, cerebral edema, and death can occur, although rarely. \n",
      "Prolonged coagulation times also may signal the development of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which, when present, carries a poor patient prognosis. Clinical manifestations can range from abnormal laboratory values to generalized bleeding occurring approximately 48 hours after the initial insult. DIC also may predispose patients to development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which also increases mortality. \n",
      "Treatment of hepatic failure includes the following:\n",
      "Infusion of dextrose solutions to correct hypoglycemia\n",
      "Early recognition and treatment of DIC, with replacement of clotting factors, fresh frozen plasma, platelets, and blood\n",
      "Meticulous respiratory support\n",
      "Pulmonary edema is a common complication of heatstroke and may be due to a number of factors, including fluid overload from aggressive rehydration, renal failure, congestive heart failure, and ARDS. The latter may develop because of multiple insults, including heat-induced pulmonary damage, aspiration pneumonia, and as a complication of liver failure. ARDS should be treated aggressively, with early mechanical ventilation and positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). \n",
      "AKI may occur because of direct thermal injury of the kidney, myoglobinuria, hypotension, and/or shock (acute tubular necrosis). Early manifestations of AKI include oliguria, low-grade proteinuria, and granular casts. \n",
      "AKI initially is treated with intravenous fluids, diuretics, and correction of associated acid-base and electrolyte abnormalities. In the setting of rhabdomyolysis, mannitol may be the diuretic of choice because it does not interfere with the acid-base status of the urine, and it may have antioxidant activity. Furosemide may cause tubular acidosis and, therefore, may promote myoglobin deposition within the renal tubules. Once renal failure has set in, hemodialysis is the most effective therapy. \n",
      "Compartment syndrome must be suspected in all patients who exhibit rhabdomyolysis and muscle edema and tenderness. Intramuscular compartment pressure measurements must be performed when compartment syndrome is suspected, and fasciotomy must be performed when the intramuscular pressure exceeds 50 mm Hg. Fasciotomy also should be considered when intracompartmental pressures are 30-50 mm Hg, especially when they show no tendency to decrease in 6 hours and in patients who are hypotensive. \n",
      "Consider consultation with a nephrologist as soon as renal failure occurs. Consultation with a surgeon is indicated when compartment syndrome is suspected. Consider consultation with a liver transplant service for patients with persistent fulminant liver failure. \n",
      "Patients may resume oral feeding when mental status, swallowing, and gastrointestinal tract function are normal. \n",
      "During the initial phase of therapy, neuromuscular blockade with muscular paralysis should be considered for patients who are not cooling adequately. Depolarizing agents (eg, succinylcholine) and inhaled anesthetics should be avoided because of the risk of malignant hyperthermia. Patients may resume activity when their temperature has stabilized. \n",
      "In patients with heatstroke, benzodiazepines play a major role in providing sedation, controlling convulsions, and controlling shivering. Barbiturates (eg, phenobarbital) may be used to control convulsions if benzodiazepines are not effective.\n",
      "Hypotension is treated first with cooling and intravenous crystalloid fluids; dobutamine is considered if patients are hypodynamic. Treatment of rhabdomyolysis involves infusing large amounts of intravenous fluids (as much as 10 L may be required), alkalinization of urine, and mannitol infusion. \n",
      "Benzodiazepines are safe and effective in controlling agitation, convulsions, and shivering.\n",
      "Predictability and ease of use make lorazepam the drug of choice in most cases. It may be used intravenously and is well absorbed after intramuscular injection. Its onset of action is within minutes, effects peak in 15-20 minutes, and the duration of action is 6-8 hours. \n",
      "Midazolam is a rapidly acting benzodiazepine with a short duration of action. It is ideal for sedation during short procedures and may be effective in convulsions. \n",
      "Alkalinizing agents are indicated for severe acidosis and rhabdomyolysis.\n",
      "Sodium bicarbonate is useful in alkalization of the urine to prevent acute myoglobinuric renal failure. It may be administered as a bolus injection or as an infusion. The ideal solution to which sodium bicarbonate is added should be hypotonic. \n",
      "Osmotic effects retain water during urine formation and dilute electrolytes in the urine, making resorption less efficient.\n",
      "Mannitol is the drug of choice for forced diuresis in patients with rhabdomyolysis because of a number of beneficial effects on the kidneys, including an antioxidant effect. \n",
      "Adrenergic agonist agents produce vasodilation and increase the inotropic state.\n",
      "Dobutamine is a synthetic compound structurally similar to catecholamines. It is the drug of choice for circulatory support in heatstroke. \n",
      "Long-term outpatient therapy may be required when chronic renal failure develops and when irreversible damage to the CNS, lungs, heart, and liver occurs. \n",
      "Once the acute phase is stabilized, further inpatient care may be necessary to address the complications of heatstroke.\n",
      "Heatstroke is a preventable illness, and education is the single most important tool for its prevention.\n",
      "Recognition of host risk factors and modification of behavior (eg, limiting alcohol and drug intake, avoiding use of medications and drugs that interfere with heat dissipation) and physical activity also can prevent heatstroke. \n",
      "Heatstroke is a multisystem insult that potentially can affect almost every organ system. \n",
      "The central nervous system (CNS) is especially sensitive to the damaging effects of hyperthermia. Widespread cell death occurs but is more evident in the region of the cerebellum (Purkinje cells). Heatstroke–related long-term CNS sequelae include cerebellar deficits, dementia, hemiplegia, quadriparesis, and personality changes. \n",
      "In one study, rhabdomyolysis was observed in almost all patients with EHS and in as many as 86% of patients with NEHS. Compartment syndrome is observed most commonly in patients with severe rhabdomyolysis and in patients who are immobilized. \n",
      "Acute kidney injury may occur in as many as 25-30% of patients who have heatstroke (especially EHS).\n",
      "Acute liver failure due to centrilobular hepatic necrosis and cholestasis generally occurs in the first 48 hours, but it can peak as long as 2 weeks after the onset of heatstroke. In rare instances, liver failure may be complicated by a fulminant course requiring liver transplantation. Patients who survive generally have a complete return of hepatic function. \n",
      "DIC is a rare complication and caries a poor prognosis when it occurs. Electron microscopy studies have shown that direct thermal injury to the vascular endothelium is the primary trigger of platelet aggregation and, possibly, DIC. \n",
      "ARDS may be due to direct thermal injury to the lung, or it may complicate liver failure, infection, or aspiration. When associated with liver failure, the patient's prognosis is much worse. \n",
      "Indicators of poor prognosis during acute episodes include the following:\n",
      "Initial temperature measurement higher than 41°C (106°F) or a temperature higher than 42°C (108°F) or a temperature persisting above 39°C (102°F) despite aggressive cooling measures \n",
      "Coma duration longer than 2 hours\n",
      "Severe pulmonary edema\n",
      "Delayed or prolonged hypotension\n",
      "Lactic acidosis in patients with classic heatstroke\n",
      "Acute kidney injury and hyperkalemia\n",
      "Aminotransferase levels greater than 1000 IU/L during the first 24 hours\n",
      "Education is the single most important tool for the prevention of heatstroke. The media, public education, public health programs, and athlete safety programs can play a pivotal role in increasing the public's awareness of the dangers of heat during heat waves and advising the public on methods of remaining cool. \n",
      "Similarly, drinking fluids on schedule (and not based only on thirst), frequent cooling breaks, and frequent visits to air-conditioned places are very important because even short stays in an air-conditioned environment may drastically reduce the incidence of heatstroke. \n",
      "Recognition of host risk factors and modification of behavior (eg, limiting alcohol and drug intake and the use of medications and drugs that interfere with heat dissipation) and physical activity also will prevent heatstroke. \n",

Other venues of investigation, such as a 12-lead electrocardiogram, orthostatic blood pressure readings, Holter/event recording, serum glucose and electrolytes, echocardiography, and psychiatric and/or neurology consultation should be considered prior to tilt-table testing to rule out malignant dysrhythmic, metabolic, cardiac mechanical, or psychological/neurological etiologies of syncope.[3] \n",

The patient is initially positioned supine and horizontal on the table, then tilted by degrees to a completely vertical, upright position.

      "One particular problem with tilt-table testing is the plethora of protocols with differing sensitivity, which can make reproduction of results unreliable. The reliability and accuracy of tilt-table studies is improved when combined with hemodynamic and volume measurements.[10] These procedures include nuclear hemodynamic studies, which can be performed in conjunction with an outpatient tilt-table test. They can be repeated at follow-up visits to assess response to treatment. Autonomic reflex testing, which includes the combination of vascular reactivity measures with the tilt-table test, can also be performed to improve the sensitivity of tilt-table testing.[10] However, a criterion standard for positivity remains to be. Adherence to positivity criteria is essential (see Table 2). If hemodynamic changes occur without syncope, the test is a false positive.[7] \n",

The arterial and venous circulations compensate for pooling by constricting; thus redirecting blood flow from the leg veins back toward the heart. However, poor sympathetic tone to the lower extremity blood vessels can cause the mechanisms of arterial and venous constriction to fail, resulting in a disproportionate pooling of blood in the legs, instead of returning blood to the circulation, resulting in less oxygen supplied to the brain and heart. As a result, a person feels lightheaded and may even faint. \n",

      "The central nervous system consists of the brain and the spinal cord. The peripheral nervous system consists of the extensions of neural structures beyond the central nervous system and includes somatic and autonomic divisions.\n",
      "The brain is composed of 3 main structural divisions: the cerebrum, the brainstem, and the cerebellum (see the images below). At the base of the brain is the brainstem, which extends from the upper cervical spinal cord to the diencephalon of the cerebrum. The brainstem is divided into the medulla, pons, and midbrain. Posterior to the brainstem lies the cerebellum.\n",
      "The cerebrum is the largest component of the brain. It is divided into right and left hemispheres. The corpus callosum is the collection of white matter fibers that joins these hemispheres. \n",
      "Each of the cerebral hemispheres is further divided into 4 lobes: the frontal lobe, the parietal lobe, the temporal lobe, and the occipital lobe. The medial temporal lobe structures are considered by some to be part of the so-called limbic lobe. \n",
      "Briefly, the frontal lobe is distinguished from the parietal lobe posteriorly by the central sulcus (see the image below). The frontal lobe and parietal lobes are divided inferiorly from the temporal lobe by the lateral sulcus. The parietal lobe is distinguished from the occipital lobe by the parieto-occipital sulcus on the medial surface.\n",
      "The cerebrum is further divided into the telencephalon and diencephalon. The telencephalon consists of the cortex, the subcortical fibers, and the basal nuclei. The diencephalon mainly consists of the thalamus and hypothalamus. The telencephalon of the cerebrum is disproportionately well-developed in humans as compared with other mammals. \n",
      "The outermost layer of the cerebrum is the cortex, which has a slightly gray appearance--hence the term \"gray matter.\" The cortex has a folded structure; each fold is termed a gyrus, while each groove between the folds is termed a sulcus. Cortical anatomy is discussed in greater detail below. \n",
      "Below the cortex are axons, which are long fibers that emanate from and connect neurons. Axons are insulated by myelin, which increases the speed of conduction. Myelin is what gives the white appearance to these fibers of the brain--hence the term \"white matter.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Limbic system\n",
      "\n",
      "The limbic system is a grouping of cortical and subcortical structures involved in memory formation and emotional responses. The limbic system allows for complex interactions between the cortex, the thalamus, the hypothalamus, and the brainstem. The limbic system is not defined by strict anatomic boundaries but incorporates several important structures. The limbic structures conventionally include the amygdala, the hippocampus, the fornix, the mammillary bodies, the cingulate gyrus, and the parahippocampal gyrus. \n",
      "The functional connections within the limbic system are best summarized by the Papez circuit. From the hippocampus, signals are relayed via the fornix to the mammillary bodies and via the mammillothalamic tract to the anterior nucleus of the thalamus. The thalamocingulate radiation then projects to the cingulate gyrus and back to the hippocampus to complete the circuit. The hippocampus serves as a primary output structure of the limbic system. \n",
      "Unlike the 6-layered neocortex, the hippocampus only has 3 layers and is termed the archicortex. The hippocampus is felt to be a structure that is crucial to formation of memory--more specifically, a type of memory called declarative or explicit memory. Declarative memory is essentially the ability to recall life events of the past such as what meal was eaten for breakfast or where the car is parked. \n",
      "Over time, however, certain declarative memories from the distant past can be independently recalled without the hippocampal structures. The hippocampus likely allows long-term memory encoding in the cortex and allows short-term memory retrieval. In laboratory studies of animals and humans, the hippocampus has been shown to also have a cellular memory termed \"long-term potentiation.\" \n",
      "The amygdala is a collection of nuclei that lies within the uncus. It receives multiple modes of sensory information as inputs. The outputs from the amygdala travel through the stria terminalis and the ventral amygdalofugal pathway. Output structures include the hypothalamus, as well as the thalamus, hippocampus, brainstem, and cortex. The amygdala appears to be involved in mediating the emotional aspects of memory, especially the subjective aspects of fear responses. \n",
      "The basal nuclei (formerly referred to as the basal ganglia) comprise the caudate nucleus, putamen, globus pallidus, subthalamic nucleus, and substantia nigra. Pairs of these structures bear different names. The putamen and globus pallidus combined form the lentiform nuclei. The putamen and caudate nucleus combined form the striatum. The striatum derives its name from the striped appearance given by the gray matter connections bridging across the internal capsule. The basal nuclei are closely integrated with the motor cortex, premotor cortex, and motor nuclei of the thalamus and plays a crucial role in modulation of movements. \n",
      "The primary input to the basal nuclei is from the primary motor cortex and premotor cortex (Brodmann areas 4 and 6) and consists primarily of the pyramidal cells in cortical layer V. These excitatory projections lead primarily to the striatum. The striatum also receives input from the dopaminergic cells of the substantia nigra. In turn, the striatum sends inhibitory projections to the globus pallidus externa and interna. The globus pallidus externa sends inhibitory projections to the subthalamic nucleus, which sends excitatory projections to the globus pallidus interna. The globus pallidus interna in turn projects to the ventral anterior and ventral lateral nuclei of the thalamus. \n",
      "Certain movement disorders can be traced to pathologies in the basal nuclei, the most notable being Parkinson disease, which is related to deficiencies of dopaminergic cells of the substantia nigra. Huntington disease is a heritable disorder that involves degeneration of the striatum and leads to progressive jerky, or choreiform, movement.\n",
      "Positioned between the brainstem and the telencephalon, the diencephalon is composed of the thalamus, the epithalamus, the subthalamus, and the hypothalamus. The thalamus serves as a relay station for ascending input to the cortex and receives information from each of the cardinal senses (except smell). It is hypothesized that the thalamus serves a gating function in filtering information. The thalamus consists of multiple nuclei that are briefly described here (see the image below).\n",
      "Left and right sides of the thalamus are divided by the third ventricle. Each side is then divided by the internal medullary lamina into a series of anterior nuclei, ventrolateral nuclei, and medial nuclei. Smaller nuclei are found within these regions, numbering perhaps in excess of 100. \n",
      "The anterior thalamic nuclei are functionally associated with the limbic system and share reciprocal connections with the cingulate gyrus and the mammillary bodies. The medial nuclei project to the frontal association cortex and premotor cortex, with reciprocal connectivity. \n",
      "The ventrolateral nuclei can be further divided into the ventral anterior (VA), ventral lateral (VL), ventral posterolateral (VPL), and ventral posteromedial (VPM) nuclei. The VA and VL nuclei share input from the globus pallidus and projections to the motor cortex. The VPL and VPM serve as sensory relays in the body and face, respectively. \n",
      "The lateral nuclei are divided into lateral dorsal and lateral posterior nuclei, with projections to the cingulate gyrus and parietal cortex, respectively. \n",
      "Other thalamic structures not included in the anatomic divisions above include the medial and lateral geniculate bodies, which process auditory and visual information, respectively. The pulvinar connects reciprocally with the parietal and occipital association cortex. Intralaminar nuclei within the internal medullary lamina obtain input from the brainstem, cerebellum, and other thalamic nuclei and project to basal nuclei structures and other thalamic nuclei. Amongst the intralaminar nuclei, the centromedian nucleus is a part of the reticular activating system, which plays a role in maintaining cortical arousal. \n",
      "The epithalamus is made up of the habenula, the habenular commissure, the posterior commissure, and the pineal gland. \n",
      "Located between the midbrain and the thalamus, the subthalamus contains the subthalamic nucleus, the red nucleus, and the substantia nigra. Subthalamic structures are closely integrated with the basal nuclei and play a role in modulation of movement. \n",
      "Thy hypothalamic nuclei lie in the walls of the third ventricle anteriorly. The hypothalamus is involved in mediating endocrine, autonomic, visceral, and homeostatic functions. It can roughly be divided into anterior, posterior, and middle groups of nuclei. \n",
      "The anterior nuclei include the preoptic, the supraoptic, and paraventricular nuclei. The posterior nuclei include the supramammillary nucleus, the mammillary nucleus, the intercalate nucleus, and the posterior nucleus. The middle nuclei include the infundibular, tuberal, dorsomedial, ventromedial, and lateral nuclei. \n",
      "Parasympathetic control can be attributed to the anterior and medial nuclear groups, whereas sympathetic control can be attributed to the posterior and lateral nuclear groups. Satiety can be localized to stimulation of medial nuclei, and hunger can be localized to stimulation of lateral nuclei. Other functions of the hypothalamus include regulation of body temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, and water balance. \n",
      "The hypothalamus has close connections with the cingulate gyrus, frontal lobe, hippocampus, thalamus, brainstem, spinal cord, basal nuclei, and pituitary gland. \n",
      "The neocortex is the most phylogenetically developed structure of the human brain as compared with the brains of other species. The complex pattern of folding allows an increased cortical surface to occupy a smaller cranial volume. The pattern of folding that forms the sulcal and gyral patterns remains highly preserved across individuals. This enables a nomenclature for the cortical anatomy. \n",
      "The left and right cerebral hemispheres are separated by the longitudinal cerebral fissure. The principal connection between the 2 hemispheres is the corpus callosum. Each cortical hemisphere can be divided into 4 lobes: frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital. The frontal lobe can be distinguished from the temporal lobe by the lateral sulcus (Sylvian fissure). The frontal lobe can be distinguished from the parietal lobe by the central sulcus (Rolandic fissure). The parieto-occipital sulcus, which is visible on the medial aspect of the hemisphere, divides the parietal and occipital lobes. Within the lateral sulcus is another cortical surface referred to as the insula. \n",
      "The frontal lobe can then be further divided into the superior, middle, and inferior frontal gyri, which are divided by the superior and inferior frontal sulci, respectively. The inferior frontal gyrus forms the frontal operculum, which overlies the lateral sulcus. The frontal operculum can be divided into 3 triangular gyri: the pars orbitalis, the pars triangularis, and the pars opercularis, in order from anterior to posterior. The precentral gyrus is the gyrus immediately anterior to the central sulcus. \n",
      "Similarly, the temporal lobe is divided into the superior, middle, and inferior temporal gyri, which are separated by the superior and inferior temporal sulci. On the inferior surface of the temporal lobe just lateral to the midbrain the parahippocampal gyrus can be identified, with the collateral sulcus lying lateral. Between the parahippocampal gyrus and the inferior temporal gyrus lies the occipitotemporal gyrus, also known as the fusiform gyrus. \n",
      "Within the parietal lobe, the superior temporal sulcus is capped by the angular gyrus. Just above this, the lateral sulcus is capped by the supramarginal gyrus. Just below the angular gyrus, the lateral occipital gyrus caps the inferior temporal sulcus. \n",
      "Evolutionarily, the brainstem is the most ancient part of the brain. Structurally, it can be divided into the medulla oblongata, pons, and midbrain. These three structures are briefly described below. Cross-sectional anatomy of the brainstem is rather complex, given the multiple traversing pathways and cranial nerve nuclei (see the image below).[1, 2, 3] \n",
      "The medulla oblongata, or simply medulla, is continuous with and superior to the cervical spinal cord. There are several external anatomic features of the medulla that can be visible grossly. Ventrally, the pyramids and pyramidal decussation is visualized just below the pons. These are the descending corticospinal tracts. Just lateral to the pyramids, the rootlets of the hypoglossal nerve can be seen as they exit the brainstem. Lateral to the rootlets of the hypoglossal nerve is the inferior olive. Dorsolateral to the inferior olive, the rootlets of the 9th and 10th cranial nerves (glossopharyngeal and vagus) exit.\n",
      "Dorsally, 2 pairs of protrusions are visible, which are the gracile tubercles medially and the cuneate tubercles just lateral to those. These represent the nuclei where sensory information from the dorsal columns is relayed onto thalamic projection neurons. Just superior to these protrusions is the floor of the fourth ventricle, which bears several characteristic impressions. The vagal trigone is the dorsal nucleus of the vagus nerve (cranial nerve X) and lies inferiorly, just below the hypoglossal trigone. \n",
      "Superior to the medulla lies the pons, the ventral surface of which has a characteristic band of horizontal fibers. These fibers are the pontocerebellar fibers that are in turn projections from the corticopontine fibers. They cross to enter the contralateral middle cerebellar peduncle and thus enter the cerebellum. \n",
      "On either side of the midline, there are bulges that are produced by the descending corticospinal tracts. At the pontomedullary junction, the 6th cranial nerve (abducens) can be seen exiting the brainstem. Laterally, but anterior to the middle cerebellar peduncle, the fifth cranial nerve (trigeminal) is seen exiting the brainstem. Below the middle cerebellar peduncle, the seventh and eighth cranial nerves (facial and vestibulocochlear) can be seen exiting. Dorsally, the pons forms the floor of the fourth ventricle. \n",
      "The midbrain, also termed the mesencephalon, is the superiormost aspect of the brainstem. Ventrally, the midbrain appears as 2 bundles that diverge rostrally as the cerebral peduncles. Between the cerebral peduncles, the third cranial nerve (oculomotor) can be seen exiting. The fourth cranial nerve (trochlear) exits dorsally and is unique in this regard. It then courses anteriorly against the cerebral peduncles. \n",
      "The posterior aspect of the midbrain has 2 pairs of characteristic protrusions, the superior and inferior colliculi. The superior colliculi are involved in mediating the vestibulo-ocular reflex, whereas the inferior colliculi are involved in sound localization. \n",
      "There are 12 pairs of cranial nerves that function mainly to convey motor signals to and sensory information from the head and neck. The lower cranial nerves have somewhat more complex visceral functions that are not strictly limited to the head and neck. The cranial nerves are as follows:\n",
      "I: The olfactory nerve relays information from the nerves of the olfactory epithelium to mesial temporal lobe and frontal lobe structures\n",
      "II: The optic nerve relays visual information from the retina; the right and left optic nerves then join at the optic chiasm, where they give rise to the optic tracts, which convey visual information to the thalamus and brainstem and, ultimately, the visual cortex; optic gliomas can arise from the optic nerve \n",
      "III: The oculomotor nerve is principally involved in the control of eye movements through its innervation of the superior rectus, the medial rectus, the inferior rectus, and the inferior oblique muscles\n",
      "IV: The trochlear nerve innervates the superior oblique muscle and is purely a motor nerve\n",
      "V: The trigeminal nerve is both a motor and sensory nerve and has 3 divisions, V1 (the ophthalmic division), V2 (the maxillary division), and V3 (the mandibular division); it is involved in conveying sensory information from the face and also in controlling the muscles of mastication; vascular compression of the branches of the trigeminal nerve near its entry into the brainstem has been associated with some types of facial pain, including trigeminal neuralgia\n",
      "VI: The abducens nerve innervates the lateral rectus nerve, allowing lateral eye movements\n",
      "VII: The facial nerve is principally involved in innervation of the muscles of facial expression and also plays a role in tearing, salivation, and taste; Bell's palsy is a relatively common facial nerve palsy \n",
      "VIII: The vestibulocochlear nerve is a purely sensory nerve that conveys auditory information from the cochlea to the brainstem via the cochlear branch; the vestibular branch conveys proprioceptive information about head position and movement from the inner ear to the brainstem; acoustic neuromas are typically benign tumors that can arise from the vestibular portion of this nerve \n",
      "IX: The glossopharyngeal nerve is involved in taste and salivation, as well as sensation in the oropharynx; the afferent limb of the gag reflex is mediated by the glossopharyngeal nerve \n",
      "X: The vagus nerve conveys visceral sensation to the brainstem and also controls some visceral functions, such as heart rate and gastrointestinal motility \n",
      "XI: The accessory nerve has contributions from a spinal component and innervates neck muscles involved in head turning\n",
      "XII: The hypoglossal nerve is a motor nerve that innervates muscles of the tongue\n",
      "The cerebellum occupies the posterior fossa, dorsal to the pons and medulla. It is involved primarily in modulating motor control to enable precisely coordinated body movements. Similar to the cerebrum, which has gyri and sulci, the cerebellum has finer folia and fissures that increase the surface area.\n",
      "The cerebellum consists of 2 hemispheres, connected by a midline structure called the vermis. In contrast to the neocortex of the cerebrum, the cerebellar cortex has 3 layers: molecular, Purkinje, and granular. There are 4 deep cerebellar nuclei: the fastigial, globose, emboliform, and dentate nuclei, in sequence from medial to lateral. The afferent and efferent pathways to and from the cerebellum exist within the 3 cerebellar peduncles.\n",
      "In children, the cerebellum is a common location for tumors such as juvenile pilocytic astrocytomas and medulloblastomas. In adults, the posterior fossa is a very common location for metastatic tumors but also a common location for tumors such as hemangioblastomas. Another pathology of the posterior fossa can occur when the cerebellar tonsils descend below the foramen magnum; this is termed a Chiari I malformation. \n",
      "The meninges consist of 3 tissue layers that cover the brain and spinal cord: the pia, arachnoid, and the dura mater (see the image below). The pia along with the arachnoid are referred to as the leptomeninges, whereas the dura is referred to as the pachymeninx.\n",
      "The innermost of the 3 layers is the pia mater, which tightly covers the brain itself, conforming to its grooves and folds. This layer is rich with blood vessels that descend into the brain.\n",
      "Outside the pia mater, which tightly contours the brain, is the arachnoid mater. The arachnoid mater is a thin weblike layer. Between the pia mater and the arachnoid mater is a space called the subarachnoid space, which contains cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). This space is where the major arteries supplying blood to the brain lie. If a blood vessel ruptures in this space, it can cause a subarachnoid hemorrhage. The arachnoid cap cells can give rise to meningiomas, a usually benign tumor.\n",
      "The outermost meningeal layer is the dura mater, which lines the interior of the skull. The dura mater is composed of 2 individual layers, the meningeal dura and the periosteal dura. For the most part, these layers are fused; venous sinuses can be found in areas of separation. The tentorium cerebelli is a dura mater fold that separates the cerebellum from the cerebrum. The falx cerebri is a fold that separates the left and right cerebral hemispheres.\n",
      "Between the arachnoid mater and the dura mater is the subdural space. If bleeding occurs in the space underneath the dura mater, it is called a subdural hematoma. If bleeding occurs outside the dura but underneath the skull, this is called an epidural hematoma. \n",
      "The brain is bathed in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which is continuously produced and absorbed. The ventricles are CSF-containing cavities within the brain. The structures that produce CSF are contained within the ventricles and are called the choroid plexuses. CSF is produced at a rate of about 450 mL/day, although at any given time about 150 mL can be found within the CSF spaces. Thus, the volume of CSF in most adults is turned over about 3 times per day.\n",
      "The brain has 4 ventricles (see the image below). Within the cerebral hemispheres are the lateral ventricles, which are connected to each other and to the third ventricle through a pathway called the interventricular foramen (of Monro). The third ventricle lies in the midline, separating deeper brain structures such as the left and right thalami. The third ventricle communicates with the fourth ventricle through the cerebral aqueduct (of Sylvius), which is a long narrow tube.\n",
      "From the fourth ventricle, CSF flows into the subarachnoid space around both the brain and the spinal cord. From the subarachnoid space, CSF is then absorbed into the venous system. Arachnoid granulations or villi are structures projecting into the superior sagittal sinus that release CSF back into the venous system.\n",
      "Hydrocephalus is a condition in which production of CSF is disproportionate to absorption. This is most commonly caused by impaired absorption resulting from obstruction of the CSF circulatory pathways, in which case it is termed obstructive hydrocephalus. This also occurs when the absorption of CSF is impaired, in which case it is termed communicating hydrocephalus. Rarely is hydrocephalus caused by increased CSF production. \n",
      "Arteries supply blood to the brain via 2 main pairs of vessels: the internal carotid artery and the vertebral artery on each side. The internal carotid artery on each side terminates into the anterior cerebral artery, the middle cerebral artery, and the posterior communicating artery. The vertebral arteries on each side join to form the basilar artery. The basilar artery then gives rise to the posterior cerebral arteries and the superior cerebellar arteries.\n",
      "The basilar artery, the posterior cerebral arteries, the posterior communicating arteries, and the anterior cerebral arteries, along with the anterior communication artery, form an important collateral circulation at the base of the brain termed the cerebral arterial circle (of Willis). These vessels lie within the subarachnoid space and are a common location for cerebral aneurysms to form.\n",
      "Venous return to the heart occurs through a combination of deep cerebral veins and superficial cortical veins. The veins then contribute to larger venous sinuses, which lie within the dura and ultimately drain through the internal jugular veins to the brachiocephalic veins and then into the superior vena cava.\n",
      "The cellular structure of the brain is composed primarily of neurons and their support cells, which are broadly termed glial cells. The 3 principal types of glial cells are astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia. These glial cells can give rise to glial tumors, such as astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas, and glioblastomas, which are among the most common primary brain tumors.\n",
      "When examined histologically, the neurons of the cortical gray matter demonstrate a laminar pattern. The neocortex contains 6 distinct layers, in contrast to the evolutionarily older paleocortex and archicortex, which typically contain 3 layers. The specific cytoarchitectural patterns of the cortex are not uniform throughout the cerebral cortex, and their variation was mapped by the German physician Korbinian Brodmann and presented in 1909. The so-called Brodmann areas represent cytoarchitectural differences across different brain regions, and the numbering scheme developed by Brodmann is still used to refer to distinct areas of the cortex.[4] \n",
      "See the list below:\n",
      "I: The molecular layer is the outermost layer of the cortex, which lies adjacent to the pial surface\n",
      "II: The external granular layer is a dense layer of primarily inhibitory granule cells; this layer serves mainly to establish intracortical connections \n",
      "III: The external pyramidal layer contains smaller neurons than its deeper counterpart; this layer provides projections to association fibers and commissural fibers. \n",
      "IV: The internal granular layer is the principal input layer of the cortex, with input derived largely from the thalamus\n",
      "V: The internal pyramidal layer is typically the largest layer within the cortex, containing large pyramidal cells; it is one of the principal output layers of the cortex, projecting to subcortical and spinal pathways; in the motor cortex, cells of this layer are termed Betz cells \n",
      "VI: The fusiform layer contains cells that form association and projection fibers\n",
      "White matter tracts connect both nearby and distal brain structures and can be distinguished according to the types of connections they mediate.\n",
      "Projection fibers connect structures over the longest distances, such as the corticospinal projections from the motor cortex to the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord. Association fibers connect structures within the same hemisphere, such as the arcuate fasciculus, which connects the temporoparietal receptive speech areas with the frontal speech areas. Commissural fibers connect homologous structures in the left and right hemispheres, the most notable example being the corpus callosum.\n",
      "Diffusion tensor imaging has emerged recently as a magnetic resonance imaging tool that provides exceptionally detailed white matter tractography in both normal and pathologic anatomy.\n",
      "The glial cells provide supportive and regulatory functions for neurons, and in fact glial cells outnumber neurons. Three principal types of glial cells exist: microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes.\n",
      "Microglia have a function in the brain similar to that of the immune system. Astrocytes play a role in creating the blood-brain barrier, which allows certain substances to selectively pass from the capillary system. They are also responsible for reactive scar formation in the brain. Oligodendrocytes form myelin, which serves to electrically insulate the axons of nerve cells, allowing increased rates of conduction.\n",
      "Abnormal proliferation of oligodendrocytes and astrocytes can lead to primary brain tumors called oligodendrogliomas and astrocytomas. Collectively, these belong to a family of tumors called gliomas, and the most aggressive type is termed a glioblastoma multiforme. \n",
      "Our current understanding of functional localization in the cortex (see the image below) is derived from several sources, which include insights from patients with lesions involving specific areas of the cortex, awake mapping of the cortex during brain surgery, and functional imaging studies such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) in healthy volunteers.\n",
      "Some of the earliest contributions to modern language mapping can be traced to the work of neurologist Paul Broca, who studied the language deficits in patients with stroke. Broca's area, as it is termed, is a region of the frontal operculum, which also overlaps with Brodmann area 44 and 45. Three overlapping names describe this region, which is responsible for speech production. Selective damage to this region leads to difficulty speaking but typically with preserved comprehension.\n",
      "In contrast, Wernicke's area refers to the posterior aspect of the superior temporal gyrus, which overlaps with Brodmann area 22. This region is generally responsible for speech comprehension, and selective injury to it can lead to impaired understanding with preserved speech production.\n",
      "Additionally, language function is hemispherically dominant. This means that Broca's and Wernicke's aphasia typically result from damage to the hemisphere that is dominant for language. In right-handed individuals, the left hemisphere is nearly always dominant for language. However, among left-handed individuals, the left hemisphere is dominant for speech in only 70%. Bilateral representation occurs in 15% of left-handed people, and right-hemisphere language representation occurs in 15% of left-handed people.\n",
      "The primary motor and sensory cortex have been mapped extensively through intraoperative stimulation in awake patients. Early work performed by neurosurgeon Wilder Penfield in Montreal led to the conceptualization of the homunculus, which is the somatotopic representation of the body in both the primary motor and primary sensory cortex (see the image below).\n",
      "The primary motor cortex corresponds with the precentral gyrus, or Brodmann area 4. Intraoperative stimulation of the motor cortex in awake patients leads to contralateral muscle contraction in a single muscle or discrete group of muscles. The premotor cortex, which corresponds to Brodmann area 6, is also occupied with movement, but typically more complex movements are elicited by stimulation here.\n",
      "The primary sensory cortex corresponds with the postcentral gyrus, or Brodmann areas 1-3. The homunculus obtained from awake mapping corresponds to that of the motor cortex. Stimulation in awake patients during surgery typically leads to the subjective sensation of tingling of the corresponding body part on the opposite side of the body. Caudally, the superior parietal lobule, Brodmann areas 5 and 7, represents the secondary sensory cortex, which is felt to subserve multimodal sensory information.\n",
      "The primary visual cortex corresponds to Brodmann area 17 and occupies the occipital pole. It is also termed the striate cortex. The visual cortex is retinotopically organized. Surrounding the primary visual cortex is the visual association cortex, or Brodmann areas 18 and 19.\n",
      "The primary auditory cortex lies on the superior bank of the superior temporal gyrus and corresponds to Brodmann area 41. Like the primary motor, primary sensory, and visual cortices, the primary auditory cortex is tonotopically organized. The auditory association cortex, or Brodmann area 42, surrounds the primary auditory cortex.\n",

      "This article discusses the anatomy of the auditory pathway (see the following images), as well as a few physiologic considerations and clinical applications.\n",
      "The eighth cranial nerve (CN VIII) or vestibulocochlear nerve is composed of 2 different sets of fibers: (1) the cochlear nerve and (2) the vestibular nerve. These 2 nerves are anatomically and physiologically different. The peripheral segments of the cochlear and vestibular nerves join at the lateral part of the internal auditory canal (IAC) to form the vestibulocochlear nerve. They are also joined by the facial nerve in the IAC.[1, 2] The length of the vestibulocochlear nerve, from the glial-Schwann junction to the brainstem, is 10-13 mm in the human male and 7-10 mm in females.\n",
      "Embryologically, the vestibulocochlear (acousticovestibular) ganglion initially develops fused with the VIIth nerve (facial) ganglion. Separation of the 3 components occurs gradually. The vestibular and cochlear (acoustic) ganglia neuroblasts are derived almost exclusively from the otocyst epithelium, in contrast to other cranial sensory ganglia in which both ganglionic and neural crest placodes make extensive contributions to the neuroblast populations. However, supporting Schwann and satellite cells, as in all cranial ganglia, are entirely of neural crest origin, apparently arising from the ganglion of the facial nerve (see the image below).[3, 4, 5, 6, 7] \n",
      "The ascending pathway transmits impulses from the spiral organ (of Corti) to the cerebral cortex (see the following image).\n",
      "\n",
      "First-order neurons of the auditory system\n",
      "\n",
      "The fibers of the cochlear nerve originate from an aggregation of nerve cell bodies in the spiral ganglion, located in the modiolus of the cochlea. The neurons of the spiral ganglion are the first of 4 order neurons between the cochlea and the cerebrum. They are bipolar cells, because they have 2 sets of processes, or fibers, that extend from opposite ends of the cell bodies. The longer central fibers, also called the primary auditory fibers, form the cochlear nerve, and the shorter, peripheral fibers extend to the bases of the inner and outer hair cells. They extend radially from the spiral ganglion to the habenula perforata, a series of tiny holes beneath the inner hair cells. At this point, they become demyelinated to enter the spiral organ (of Corti).\n",
      "Only about 30,000 of these fibers exist, and the greater number of them—about 95%—innervate the inner hair cells. The remainder cross the tunnel of Corti to innervate the outer hair cells. The longer central processes of the bipolar cochlear neurons unite to form the cochlear nerve trunk. These primary auditory fibers exit the modiolus through the internal meatus and enter the medulla oblongata. The \"mouth\" of the internal auditory canal (IAC) is called the porus acusticus. The anatomic relationship of the VIIth and VIIIth nerves in the IAC and the cerebellopontine angle region are important anatomic areas related to skull base surgery and neuro-otologists.\n",
      "The VIIth and VIIIth nerves are encased in glial tissue throughout their intracranial course. These nerves are surrounded by Schwann cells beginning in the IAC close to the porus acusticus. The Obersteiner-Redlich zone is the glial-Schwann junction.\n",
      "The Scarpa (vestibular) ganglion lies approximately in the middle of the IAC. The division of cranial nerve (CN) VIII into the cochlear and vestibular branches may occur in the medial segment of the IAC or in the subarachnoid space. The posterior half of the IAC is occupied by the superior and inferior branches of the vestibular nerve. The cochlear nerve is located anteroinferiorly in the canal. The VIIth nerve is located in the anterosuperior portion of the IAC. A vertical crest (Bill bar) separates the facial and superior vestibular nerves in the upper part of the IAC. The transverse crest separates this upper portion of the IAC from the lower part containing the lower vestibular and cochlear divisions.\n",
      "The cerebellopontine angle is a potential space in the posterior cranial fossa. Its boundaries are as follows:\n",
      "Anteriorly: Posterior fossa of the temporal bone\n",
      "Posteriorly: Anterior surface of the cerebellum\n",
      "Medially: Inferior olive\n",
      "Superiorly: Inferior border of the pons and cerebellar peduncle\n",
      "Inferiorly: The cerebellar tonsil\n",
      "The trigeminal nerve is visible superior to the cerebellopontine angle, whereas the IXth, Xth, and XIth nerves course inferiorly. Other important structures within the cerebellopontine angle include the anterior inferior cerebellar artery (AICA), flocculus, and lateral aperture of the fourth ventricle (foramen of Luschka). The labyrinthine artery is usually a branch of the AICA and supplies the cochlea and labyrinth.\n",
      "After entering the medulla, the cochlear nerve fibers proceed to the cochlear nucleus. The cochlear nucleus consists of 5 distinct cell types, each with distinct morphologic and physiologic features, such as response to stimulus onset, stimulus offset, and frequency modulation. The cochlear nucleus is divided into the dorsal and ventral parts. The cochlear fibers divide into 2 main bundles: One group passes lateral and dorsal to the restiform body; the other group remains slightly ventral and medial to the restiform body and terminates in the ventral cochlear nucleus. Fibers coming from the basal coils of the cochlea have been found to terminate in the in the dorsal part of the dorsal cochlear nucleus. The fibers from the apical parts of the cochlea end in the ventral part of the dorsal cochlear nucleus and the ventral nucleus. However, some fibers pass to higher order neurons further along the pathway before they synapse.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second-, third-, and fourth-order neurons of the auditory system\n",
      "\n",
      "The cell bodies of the second order neurons lie in the dorsal and ventral cochlear nuclei. Some fibers from the ventral cochlear nucleus pass across the midline to the cells of the superior olivary complex, whereas others make connection with the olivary cells of the same side. The superior olivary complex is considered the first center in the ascending auditory system, where inputs from both ears converge. Together, these fibers form the trapezoid body (where the third order neurons are located).\n",
      "Fibers from the dorsal cochlear nucleus cross the midline to end on the cells of the nuclei of the lateral lemniscus. There they are joined by the fibers from the ventral cochlear nuclei of both sides and from the olivary complex. Auditory nuclei above the superior olivary complex can be excitatory or inhibitory with inputs from each ear. The lemniscus is a major tract, most of the fibers of which end in the inferior colliculus, the auditory center of the midbrain.\n",
      "The inferior colliculus is a complex nucleus with at least 18 major cell types and at least 5 areas of specialization. It is involved in all areas of auditory behavior, including differential sensitivity for frequency and intensity, loudness, and binaural hearing. Although some fibers may bypass the colliculus and end, together with the fibers from the colliculus, at the next higher level, the medial geniculate body of the thalamus is where the fourth order neurons are located. From the medial geniculate body, there is an orderly projection of fibers to a portion of the cortex of the temporal lobe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Auditory input\n",
      "\n",
      "The primary auditory cortex is the first region of the cerebral cortex to receive auditory input. In humans and other primates, the primary acoustic area in the cerebral cortex is the superior transverse temporal gyri of Heschl, a ridge in the temporal lobe, on the lower lip of the deep cleft between the temporal and parietal lobes, known as the lateral sulcus (Sylvian fissure).\n",
      "Because about half of the fibers of the auditory pathways cross the midline whereas others ascend on the same side of the brain, each ear is represented in both the right and left cortex. For this reason, even when the auditory cortical area of one side is injured by trauma or stroke, binaural hearing may be minimally affected.\n",
      "Perception of sound is associated with the right posterior superior temporal gyrus (STG). The superior temporal gyrus contains several important structures of the brain, including Brodmann 41 and 42, marking the location of the primary auditory cortex, the cortical region responsible for the sensation of basic characteristics of sound such as pitch and rhythm.\n",
      "The auditory association area is located within the temporal lobe of the brain, in an area called the Wernicke area or area 22. This area, near the lateral cerebral sulcus, is an important region for the processing of acoustic signals so that they can be distinguished as speech, music, or noise.\n",
      "As is common for thalamocortical connections, nuclei within the medial geniculate body that send fibers to the auditory cortex also receive fibers from the same area of the cortex. Impaired hearing due to bilateral cortical injury involving both auditory areas has been reported, but it is extremely rare. However, bilateral lesions of the temporal lube have been shown to produce wide-ranging effects (cortical deafness, in which several behaviors are affected, including speech discrimination, localization of sound, and the detection of faint, short-duration signals).\n",
      "The following image depict the conscious and reflex afferent auditory pathways.\n",
      "Besides the conscious and reflex afferent auditory pathways, descending efferent pathways also exist. Efferent projections from the brain to the cochlea also play a role in the perception of sound. In general, the descending pathways have an inhibiting effect upon the ascending fibers, and they tend to provide self-regulation to the auditory system. Each relay auditory station is considered to be dually innervated, thus providing a way for incoming impulses to be internally influenced, modified, or negated.\n",
      "Parallel with the pathway ascending from the cochlear nuclei to the cortex is a pathway descending from the cortex to the cochlear nuclei. In both pathways, some of the fibers remain on the same side, whereas others cross the midline to the opposite side of the brain. Evidence of a \"spur\" line ascending from the dorsal cochlear nucleus to the cerebellum and another descending from the inferior colliculus to the cerebellum also exist.\n",
      "The significance of these cerebral connections is not clear, but they may antedate the evolutionary development of the cerebral cortex. From the superior olivary complex, a region in the medulla oblongata, a fiber tract called the olivocochlear bundle also originates (see the image below). It constitutes an efferent system, or feedback loop, by which nerve impulses, thought to be inhibitory, reach the hair cells.\n",
      "See Inner Ear for details regarding the microscopic anatomy and innervation of the cells in the spiral organ (of Corti)[8, 9, 7] . The following images depict this area.\n",
      "The complex chain of nerve cells in the auditory system helps to process and relay auditory information, encoded in the form of nerve impulses, directly to the highest cerebral levels in the cortex of the brain. To some extent, different properties of the auditory stimulus are conveyed along distinct parallel pathways. This method of transmission, employed by other sensory systems, provides a way for the central nervous system (CNS) to analyze different properties of the single auditory stimulus, with some information processed at low levels and other information at higher levels. At lower levels of the pathway, information as to pitch, loudness, and localization of sounds is processed, and appropriate responses, such as the contraction of the intra-aural muscles, turning of the eyes and head, or movements of the body as a whole, are initiated.[7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15] \n",
      "The patterns of spatial representations of the spiral organ (of Corti) at the lower levels of the auditory pathway seem to be in accord with the place theory of the cochlear analysis of sound. Physiologic evidence of tuning of the auditory system has also been obtained by recording the electrical potentials from individual neurons at various levels. Most neurons of the auditory pathway show a \"best frequency,\" that is, a frequency to which the individual neuron responds at minimal intensity (see the image below).\n",
      "This finding is entirely compatible with experimental evidence of frequency tuning of the hair cells. With each increase in the intensity of the sound, the neuron is able to respond to a wider band of frequencies, thus reflecting the broad tuning of the basilar membrane. Increased intensity of stimulation causes a more rapid rate of responding. The pitch of a sound tends to be coded in terms of which neurons are responding, and its loudness is determined by the rate of response and the total number of neurons activated.\n",
      "The localization of sounds from a stationary source in the horizontal plane is known to depend on the recognition of minute differences in the intensity and time of arrival of the sound at the 2 ears. A sound that arrives at the left ear a few microseconds sooner than it does at the right or that sounds a few decibels louder in that ear is recognized as coming from the left. In a real-life situation, the head may also be turned to pinpoint the sound by facing it and thus canceling these differences. For low-frequency tones, a difference in phase at the 2 ears is the criterion for localization, but for higher frequencies, the difference in loudness caused by the sound shadow of the head becomes all-important.\n",
      "Such comparisons and discriminations appear to be carried out at the brainstem and midbrain levels of the central auditory pathway. The spectral shapes of sounds have been shown to be most important for determining the elevation of a source that is not in the horizontal plane. Localization of sound that emanates from a moving source is a more complicated task for the nervous system and apparently involves the cerebral cortex and short-term memory. Injury to the auditory area of the cortex on one side of the brain interferes with the localization of a moving sound source on the opposite side of the body.\n",
      "Experimental studies have indicated that the cortex is not even necessary for frequency recognition, which can be carried out at lower levels, but that it is essential for the recognition of temporal patterns of sound. Therefore, the cortex appears to be reserved for the analysis of more complex auditory stimuli, such as speech and music, for which the temporal sequence of sounds is equally important.\n",
      "Presumably, it is also at the cortical level that the meaning of sounds is interpreted and behavior is adjusted in accordance with their significance. Such functions were formerly attributed to an \"auditory association area\" immediately surrounding the primary area, but they probably should be thought of as involving much more of the cerebral cortex, thanks to the multiple, parallel interconnections between the various areas.\n",
      "Each cochlear nucleus receives impulses only from the ear of the same side. A comparison between the responses of the 2 ears first becomes possible at the superior olivary complex, which receives fibers from both cochlear nuclei. Some neurons of the accessory nucleus of the olivary complex respond to impulses from both ears. Others respond to impulses from one side only, but their response is modified by the simultaneous arrival of impulses from the other side.\n",
      "The auditory system appears to be capable of making the minute fine discriminations of time and intensity that are necessary for localization of sound. By virtue of such bilateral neural interconnections in the brain, the 2 ears together can be much more effective than 1 ear alone in picking out a particular sound in the presence of a background of noise. They also permit attention to be directed to a single source of sound. This is one aspect of the \"cocktail party effect,\" whereby a listener with normal hearing can attend to different conversations in turn or concentrate on one speaker despite the surrounding babble.\n",
      "The observation that most of the significantly activated areas were the same with monaural or binaural stimulation suggests that the differences in auditory perception with binaural stimulation are not due to the involvement of significantly different centers but, more likely, to the type of information that reaches these centers for processing. Furthermore, the degree of stimulation may be less intense in binaural than in monaural stimulation. This supports the concept that a richer binaural auditory stimulation compared with monaural stimulation does not mean summation of stimuli but integration and better processing of the information.\n",
      "Whether the muscles within the ear play a part in filtering out unwanted sounds during such selective listening has not been established. The less-favorable aspect of the \"cocktail party effect\" is that such background noises mask dialogue, which can make following a conversation difficult for persons with sensorineural impairment. Efferent projections from the brain to the cochlea also play a role in the perception of sound. Efferent synapses occur on outer hair cells and on afferent dendrites under inner hair cells.\n",
      "A few clinical applications related to the auditory pathway are addressed in this section.\n",
      "The most obvious application on the study of the auditory central nervous system (CNS) involves the interpretation of auditory evoked potentials (AEPs). The auditory brainstem response (ABR), which was first reported in 1967, is a component of these potentials. ABR is a series of 7 waves occurring within 10-15 milliseconds after the onset of an acoustic stimulus. The waves test the function of the auditory nerve and auditory pathways in the brainstem. Each wave is generated as follows (in normal subjects)[9, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21] :\n",
      "Waves I and II: VIIIth nerve\n",
      "Wave III: Cochlear nucleus\n",
      "Wave IV: Superior olive/lateral lemniscus\n",
      "Wave V: Lateral lemniscus/inferior colliculus\n",
      "The following are 3 main uses of ABR:\n",
      "Threshold testing of infants, young children, and malingerers\n",
      "Diagnosis of acoustic neuromas\n",
      "Diagnosis of brainstem lesions and neuropathies\n",
      "There are 2 other uses of ABR that are gaining popularity: (1) screening of babies in the intensive care unit (ICU) who are at risk for hearing loss, and (2) intraoperative monitoring during surgery such as VIIIth nerve vascular decompression and vestibular nerve section.\n",
      "Techniques for measuring efferent effects using otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) are now well developed and have promise in clinical applications ranging from predicting which patients are susceptible to acoustic trauma to characterizing relationships between efferent activation and learning disabilities.\n",
      "Efferent auditory pathways modulate the outer hair cells of the cochlea, protect against noise, and improve the detection of sound sources in noisy environments. In a prospective clinical, quantitative, cross-sectional, contemporary study, Fronza et al concluded that, in young, normal-hearing adults who experience efferent auditory pathways dysfunctions (such as tinnitus and hearing impairment), possible associations with genotoxicity exist, as well as interactions between sex and smoking.[14, 22] \n",
      "Neuroscience research on auditory processing pathways and their behavioral and electrophysiologic correlates has provided important clinical applications. Deviations and disruptions in auditory pathways in children and adolescents result in a well-documented range of developmental and learning impairments frequently referred for neuropsychologic evaluation.\n",
      "Until recently, researchers used behavioral measures of identification and discrimination of speech and nonspeech stimuli to assess the effects of auditory deprivation, enhancement, and training. Recent advances to measure electrical activity in the auditory system in response to sound have made it possible to study how changes in auditory input (hearing loss, auditory input modification, or training) affect the function of the central auditory system. The evidence of changes in the auditory cortex in mature animals and in humans with acquired sensorineural hearing loss as well as changes associated with auditory training in persons with normal hearing has been reported.\n",
      "The results of a study that measures psychoacoustic and speech-recognition performance of persons with hearing loss, with and without hearing aids, are interpreted within the framework of new knowledge about plasticity of the auditory system. Applications of electrophysiologic techniques to hearing aid research and clinical practice are also elaborated in this study.\n",
      "Both cochlear implants (CI) and auditory brainstem implants (ABI) have been shown to aid significantly in providing sound to individuals suffering from total sensorineural hearing loss. A prime candidate for cochlear implantation is described, as follows:\n",
      "Having severe to profound sensorineural loss in both ears\n",
      "Having a functioning auditory nerve\n",
      "Having lived at least a short time period without hearing (approximately 70+ decibel hearing loss, on average)\n",
      "Having good speech, language, and communication skills, or, in the case of infants and young children, having a family willing to work toward speech and language skills with therapy\n",
      "Not benefitting enough from other kinds of hearing aids\n",
      "Having no medical reason to avoid surgery\n",
      "Living in or desiring to live in the \"hearing world\"\n",
      "Having realistic expectations about results\n",
      "Having the support of family and friends\n",
      "Having appropriate services set up for postcochlear implant aural rehabilitation (through a speech language pathologist, deaf educator, or auditory verbal therapist)\n",
      "Cochlear nerve deficiency (CND) is increasingly diagnosed in children with sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). Clemmens et al (2013) used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to study the prevalence of CND and the correlations with audiologic phenotype in children with unilateral SNHL.[23] They found that CND was present in 26% of children with unilateral SNHL. Its prevalence was higher (48%) in severe-to-profound SNHL, especially when in infants (100%). In addition, ophthalmologic abnormalities were very common (67%) in children with CND, particularly oculomotor disturbances.\n",
      "Yan et al (2013) also found that hypoplastic cochlear nerve canal might be more indicative of CND than that of a narrow internal auditory canal.[24] \n",
      "Ryugo found that the auditory brain is highly malleable by experience.[25] Using the congenitally deaf white cat, he showed that rigorous training with cochlear implants offered the promise of new unattained benefits.\n",
      "An ABI is an implant like a cochlear implant, except that it bypasses the cochlea altogether and attaches its electrode directly to the brainstem. ABIs provide sound information by direct stimulation of the cochlear nucleus to patients with dysfunctional or absent cranial nerve VIII.\n",
      "Most of the recipients of ABIs have reported being able to hear sounds that can help them lip read, but most are not able to discriminate speech from these sounds alone. Candidates for this implant are carefully chosen. The surgery is much more invasive than the surgery required for a cochlear implants, and it is usually undertaken only in situations in which the patient is (or has become) completely deaf. However, in contrast to patients with cochlear implants, the use of ABIs is less successful. This cannot be fully explained by the different location of stimulation but rather to a nonspecific neuronal stimulation. Many candidates for the ABI trials are patients with neurofibromatosis II (NF2) who are having their second tumor removed.\n",
      "Directly comparing cochlear implants and ABIs is somewhat difficult, because both types of implants are constantly being updated. In general, however, it has been shown that the ABI, particularly the more recent multichannel ABI, provides levels of sound detection and discrimination that are similar to those provided by the original single-channel cochlear implant.\n",
      "Mandala et al found that the definition of the potential threshold and the number of auditory and extra-auditory waves generated was significantly improved by using electrical compound action potentials during auditory brainstem implantation.[26] \n",

      "Obesity is a major health problem worldwide and has reached an epidemic proportion in the Western society. Evidence continues to accumulate that obesity is a major risk factor for many diseases and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality.\n",
      "Bariatric surgery is currently the only modality that provides a significant, sustained weight loss for morbidly obese patients, with resultant improvement in obesity-related comorbidities. A prospective, controlled Swedish study involving 4047 obese patients, half of whom had undergone bariatric procedures, followed up over 14.7 years, found that compared to usual care, bariatric surgery was associated with a significantly reduced number of cardiovascular deaths and a lower incidence of cardiovascular events in obese adults.[1] \n",
      "In January 2015, the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) published a position statement on bariatric surgery for severely obese children and adolescents, which provided the following guidelines[2, 3] :\n",
      "Consider bariatric surgery in \"carefully selected\" patients with a body mass index (BMI) higher than 40 kg/m2 who have severe comorbidities (eg, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [NAFLD]) or in those with a BMI higher than 50 kg/m2 who have milder comorbidities\n",
      "Additional factors to consider in deciding whether a child or adolescent should undergo bariatric surgery include physical and psychological maturity, personal desire to undergo the procedure, previous attempts at weight loss, and ability to adhere to follow-up care \n",
      "Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding, and sleeve gastrectomy are the most widely used procedures in pediatric obesity, but their use is associated with subsequent nutritional deficiencies; temporary intragastric devices could represent a better option for initial treatment in pediatric populations \n",
      "Current evidence suggests that bariatric surgery can decrease the grade of steatosis, hepatic inflammation, and fibrosis in NAFLD \n",
      "Uncomplicated NAFLD is not an indication for bariatric surgery\n",
      "Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is considered a safe and effective option for extremely obese adolescents, as long as appropriate long-term follow-up is provided \n",
      "Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding has not been approved by the FDA for use in adolescents and therefore should be considered investigational \n",
      "Sleeve gastrectomy and other types of weight loss surgery that have grown increasingly common in adults must still be considered investigational \n",
      "In 1954, Kremen and Linner introduced jejunoileal bypass, the first effective surgery for obesity in the United States. In this procedure, the proximal jejunum was connected directly to the distal ileum, bypassing 90% of the small intestine out of the intestinal stream of ingested nutrients (blind loop). The procedure induced a state of malabsorption, which led to significant weight loss. However, many patients developed complications secondary to malabsorption (eg, steatorrhea, diarrhea, vitamin deficiencies, oxalosis) or due to the toxic overgrowth of bacteria in the bypassed intestine (eg, liver failure, severe arthritis, skin problems). Consequently, many patients have required reversal of the procedure, and the procedure has been abandoned. This led to a search for better operations.\n",
      "Modifications in the original procedures and the development of new techniques have led to 3 basic concepts for bariatric surgery: (1) gastric restriction (adjustable gastric banding, sleeve gastrectomy), (2) gastric restriction with mild malabsorption (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass), and (3) a combination of mild gastric restriction and malabsorption (duodenal switch). (See images below.)\n",
      "The most widely accepted measure of obesity is the body mass index (BMI). This number is calculated by dividing a patient's mass (in kilograms) by his or her height (in meters, squared). A normal BMI is considered in the range of 18.5-24.9 kg/m2. A BMI of 25-29.9 kg/m2 is considered overweight. A BMI of 30 kg/m2 or greater is classified as obese; this classification is further subdivided into class I, II, or III obesity. \n",
      "Considering other factors (eg, total muscle mass, waist circumference) besides the BMI may be important. For example, an extremely muscular individual may have an elevated BMI without being considered overweight. Waist circumference has been shown to be an excellent indicator of abdominal fat mass. A circumference of greater than 88 cm (35 in) in women or greater than 102 cm (40 in) in men strongly correlates with an increased risk of obesity-related disease. \n",
      "The number of overweight individuals in the world is estimated at 1.7 billion. In the United States, the problem is at epidemic proportions. Up to two thirds of the population in the United States is overweight, and half of the people in this group can be classified as obese. \n",
      "Obesity is a complex, multifactorial chronic disease influenced by the interaction of several factors, such as genetic, endocrine, metabolic, environmental (social and cultural), behavioral, and psychological components. The basic mechanism occurs when energy intake exceeds energy output. \n",
      "Obesity occurs as the result of an imbalance between energy expenditure and caloric intake. This imbalance has been thought to be under genetic and environmental influence. The discovery of immunological abnormalities in obesity that are related to the leptin-proopiomelanocortin system and elevated tumor necrosis factor-alpha brought a new perspective to the understanding of obesity. \n",
      "Leptin is a hormone made primarily in adipocytes. Leptin is from the Greek word leptos, for thin. The circulating leptin levels reflect the amount of stored body fat. Leptin is a negative feedback signal that acts on the hypothalamus to alter the expression of several neuroendocrine peptides that regulate energy intake and expenditure. Central resistance to leptin is a prominent feature of obesity. Increased leptin levels in individuals who are obese are independent of the lipid profile but strongly correlate with the BMI. Leptin exhibits direct effects on monocytes that results in secretion of the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA). This cytokine antagonist has anti-inflammatory properties. Although leptin treatment works very well in patients who are leptin deficient, the use of leptin in patients who are obese and who already have high levels of leptin has shown limited efficacy. \n",
      "Morbid obesity is the harbinger of many other diseases that affect essentially every organ system.\n",
      "Cardiovascular (eg, hypertension, atherosclerotic heart and peripheral vascular disease with myocardial infarction and cerebral vascular accidents, peripheral venous insufficiency, thrombophlebitis, pulmonary embolism) \n",
      "Respiratory (eg, asthma, obstructive sleep apnea, obesity-hypoventilation syndrome)\n",
      "Metabolic (eg, type 2 diabetes, impaired glucose tolerance, hyperlipidemia)\n",
      "Musculoskeletal (eg, back strain; disc disease; weightbearing osteoarthritis of the hips, knees, ankles, and feet)\n",
      "Gastrointestinal (eg, cholelithiasis, gastroesophageal reflux disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [steatosis steatohepatitis], hepatic cirrhosis, hepatic carcinoma, colorectal carcinoma)\n",
      "Urologic (eg, stress incontinence)\n",

      "Neurologic (eg, pseudotumor cerebri, carpal tunnel syndrome) \n",
      "Psychologic (eg, depression, eating disorders, body image disturbance)\n",
      "Surgery for obesity should be considered as a treatment of last resort after dieting, exercise, psychotherapy, and drug treatments have failed.\n",
      "Developed at the 1991 National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Development Conference Panel, the generally accepted criteria for surgical treatment include a BMI of greater than 40 kg/m2 or a BMI of greater than 35 kg/m2 in combination with high-risk comorbid conditions, such as sleep apnea, Pickwickian syndrome, diabetes mellitus, or degenerative joint disease.\n",
      "Contraindications to bariatric surgery include illnesses that greatly reduce life expectancy and are unlikely to be improved with weight reduction, including advanced cancer and end-stage renal, hepatic, and cardiopulmonary disease.\n",
      "Patients who are unable to understand the nature of bariatric surgery or the behavioral changes required afterward, including untreated schizophrenia, active substance abuse, and noncompliance with previous medical care, are also considered contraindications to bariatric surgery.\n",
      "Preoperative laboratory evaluation should include a complete blood count (CBC), a complete chemistry panel, liver function tests, thyroid function tests, a lipid profile, coagulation tests, serum iron and total iron binding capacity (TIBC), vitamin B-12, folic acid, blood typing, and urinalysis. \n",
      "See the list below:\n",
      "Chest radiography\n",
      "Ultrasonography of the gallbladder\n",
      "Upper endoscopy is performed to rule out intrinsic upper gastrointestinal disease, because, after gastric bypass surgery, the ability to nonsurgically visualize the distal stomach and the duodenum could be a challenge. \n",
      "A preoperative trial of weight loss is beneficial to ensure patient compliance with the postoperative diet protocol. Also, a preoperative liquid diet can shrink the liver, thus facilitating the surgical procedure. \n",
      "Types of bariatric surgery include the following:\n",
      "Restrictive procedures (eg, adjustable gastric banding, sleeve gastrectomy)\n",
      "Restrictive procedures with some malabsorption (eg, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass)\n",
      "Malabsorptive procedures with some restriction (eg, biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch)\n",
      "Bariatric surgery can be performed by an open technique and by a laparoscopic technique. The laparoscopic approach has currently become the more popular approach. \n",
      "Gastric bypass is currently the most popular procedure performed in the United States. (See image below.) This procedure has earned the reputation of being the gold standard, against which other procedures are compared. The procedure has a restrictive and a malabsorptive component.\n",
      "The gastric bypass provides a substantial amount of dietary restriction. The restriction is created by the small stomach pouch, which gives the patient a feeling of satiety after eating a small meal. The restrictive element of the operation consists of the creation of a small gastric pouch (approximately 20 mL in volume) and probably a small outlet that, on distention by food, causes the sensation of satiety. \n",
      "In addition, the gastric bypass provides a small-to-moderate degree of intentional malabsorption due to the separation of food, which passes through the alimentary limb of the Y, from the biliopancreatic secretions, which pass through the biliopancreatic limb of the Y. The degree of malabsorption can be adjusted by modifying the length of the alimentary and biliopancreatic limbs. \n",
      "The malabsorptive element is a result of bypassing the distal stomach, the entire duodenum, and varying the length of the jejunum. The extent of the bypass of the intestine determines the degree of macronutrient malabsorption. The standard Roux limb is about 75 cm. More extensive malabsorptive variations consist of gastric bypasses with a 150-cm Roux limb (long-limb) or with a very long-limb (distal gastric bypass). In addition to restricting food intake, causing some degree of malabsorption, it also causes dumping syndrome in response to a high-sugar liquid meal. \n",
      "Weight loss after a standard 75-cm Roux gastric bypass usually exceeds 100 lb or about 65-70% of excess body weight and about 35% of BMI. The longer-limb bypasses are used to obtain comparable weight reductions in patients who are super obese (BMI >50 kg/m2). Weight loss generally levels off in 1-2 years, and a regain of up to 20 lb from the weight loss nadir to a long-term plateau is common. \n",
      "For all bariatric procedures, pure reversal without conversion to another bariatric procedure is almost certainly followed by a return to morbid obesity. Gastric bypass can be reversed, though this is rarely required. \n",
      "A standard Roux gastric bypass with failed weight loss can be revised to a very long-limb Roux-en-Y procedure or the dilated gastric pouch can be revised. (See image below.)\n",
      "After gastric bypass surgery, some patients may experience dumping syndrome upon ingestion of sweets. This is caused by the rapid passage of gastric pouch contents directly into the small bowel, unimpeded by a pyloric valve. The presence of concentrated simple sugars in the Roux limb presents a substantial osmotic load that may result in cramping and abdominal discomfort; additionally, the ensuing rapid release of insulin by the pancreas may cause symptomatic hypoglycemia. This unpleasant reaction to sugar is considered to be a desired effect of gastric bypass surgery, and it has been referred to by patients as the postoperative police officer. \n",
      "Weight loss after gastric bypass has been shown to be greater than that obtained by dietary, medical, behavioral, or combined approaches to weight loss. \n",
      "A long-term follow-up study performed by MacLean et al defined postoperative success as a reduction in weight to a BMI of less than 35 kg/m2.[4] By this criterion, a successful outcome was achieved in 93% of patients with an initial BMI of less than 50 kg/m2 and in 57% of patients with an initial BMI of greater than 50 kg/m2. \n",
      "Since its initial description in 1994 by Wittgrove and others, the laparoscopic gastric bypass approach has been shown to combine the efficacy of the open approach with the decreased pain, lower wound morbidity, and shorter convalescence of a minimally invasive procedure.[5] Results of several laparoscopic gastric bypass series have paralleled or improved upon those of open surgery. In Higa's series of 400 laparoscopic procedures, patients lost an average of 69% of their initial excess weight by 12 months after their operations.[6] Schauer's group reported even better weight loss; in a group of 275 patients undergoing laparoscopic gastric bypass, there was an average loss of excess weight of 83% at 24 months after surgery. \n",
      "A prospective, randomized trial was completed that compared the results of laparoscopic gastric bypass to the results of open gastric bypass. Patients who had undergone laparoscopic gastric bypass were found to have substantially less impairment of pulmonary function after surgery and decreased postoperative pain. \n",
      "In the author's experience, the convalescence after laparoscopic gastric bypass is substantially reduced relative to open procedures, with some patients returning to work in 2 weeks or less. \n",
      "Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding is the most common bariatric procedure and is performed in Europe, Australia, and South America. (See image below.) In June 2001, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved it for use in the United States. Lap-Band (Inamed) is the only device approved for this use in the United States.\n",
      "The device consists of an adjustable inflatable band placed around the proximal part of the stomach. This creates a small gastric pouch (approximately 15 mL in volume) and a small stoma. Band restriction is adjustable by adding or removing saline from the inflatable band by a reservoir system of saline attached to the band and accessible through a port, which is attached by a catheter to the band. The port is placed subcutaneously in the anterior abdominal wall after the band is secured around the stomach. \n",
      "Adjustment of the band through the access port is an essential part of laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding therapy. Appropriate adjustments, performed up to 6 times annually, are critical for successful outcomes. Patients must chew food thoroughly to allow food to pass through the band. Adjusting the inflation of the cuff changes the size of the opening through which food passes but does not change the size of the gastric pouch; deflation of the cuff is useful when the outlet is obstructed. \n",
      "Weight loss after laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding is about 50-60% of excess body weight in approximately 2 years.\n",
      "Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding can be completely reversed with removal of the band, tubing, and port.\n",
      "Combining laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding with gastric plication may improve weight-loss outcomes, at least in the short term.[7] \n",
      "Biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch (see the image below) includes the following:\n",
      "Lateral 75% gastrectomy, resulting in a tubular stomach\n",
      "Duodenum divided past the pyloric valve\n",
      "Ileum divided\n",
      "Distal end anastomosed to proximal duodenum\n",
      "Common channel created distally with Y-anastomosis\n",
      "Optional appendectomy and cholecystectomy\n",
      "Malabsorption is achieved by separating food from biliopancreatic digestive fluids. More weight loss results from fat malabsorption. Protein absorption is also reduced. This has the best weight loss with the least regain. There is less disruption of eating patterns. Early weight loss is from restriction and malabsorption, and, later, it is mostly from malabsorption; 75-85% of excess body weight loss is at 18 months. Pyloric preservation protects against marginal ulceration and dumping syndrome. \n",
      "The procedure is technically challenging and difficult to reverse. Insurance companies may not cover this procedure because it is still considered investigational. \n",
      "Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG), a type of unbanded gastroplasty, employs subtotal gastric resection to create a long lesser curvature–based gastric conduit. (See the image below.)\n",
      "In this procedure, the stomach is reduced to about 15-20% of its original size by the surgical removal of a large portion of the stomach, following the greater curve. The mechanism of weight loss and resultant comorbidity improvement that follows sleeve gastrectomy may be related to gastric restriction or to neurohumoral changes observed following the procedure (due to the gastric resection).\n",
      "Sleeve gastrectomy has been used as the first of a 2-stage procedure for high-risk patients,[8] but owing to its simplicity and favorable outcomes,[9] it is currently being offered as a primary, stand-alone procedure. In the first decade of the 21st century, many hundreds of sleeve gastrectomies were performed in the United States. Based on follow-up periods of 6 months to 3 years, patients were found to have lost 33-83% of their excess weight.[10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24] \n",
      "Compared with other bariatric procedures, sleeve gastrectomy is the more physiologic treatment, because it does not involve malabsorption, abnormal tracts, blind tracts, or the placement of a foreign body. This procedure is widely performed laparoscopically.[22] \n",
      "Hutter et all conducted the first large, prospective, multiinstitutional study comparing 1-yr outcomes of LSG to other procedures. Results show LSG has morbidity and effectiveness between laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding and standard Roux bypass.[25] \n",
      "As with other bariatric procedures that involve stomach transaction, the main drawback of sleeve gastrectomy is the severity of postoperative complications. The use of staple-line reinforcement was shown to be associated with improved perioperative outcomes and can be considered as an effective method for preventing leaks.[26] \n",
      "A larger, prospective comparative study involving 187 patients undergoing the laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy procedure found that reinforcement of the staple line with bovine pericardium strips was associated with a significant reduction in bleeding from the staple line and intraabdominal collections, whereas the leak rate was not significantly reduced. It is unclear, though, if controlling for high BMI, previous bariatric surgery, and diabetes was taken into account.[27] \n",
      "In a randomized study that involved 120 patients who had undergone laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy, using either polyglycolide acid with tri-methylene carbonate or gelatin ﬁbrinmatrix for SLR wasfound to be faster compared to oversewing, whereas no significant differences in postoperative complications were observed between the three methods.[28] \n",
      "There has been a growing trend in bariatric surgery toward reduction of abdominal incisions, a change offering much-improved cosmetic outcomes and, potentially, shorter patient hospital stays. (See the image below.)\n",
      "Such minimally invasive surgery also provides, as a result of decreased abdominal trauma, reductions in pain, scarring, and tissue injury. Saber and colleagues developed a single-incision, transumbilical laparoscopic approach for sleeve gastrectomies, in which the procedure is performed mainly through the umbilicus; the sleeve is extracted through the umbilicus without extending the incision.[22] \n",
      "In addition, Saber and colleagues developed a single-incision, transumbilical laparoscopic technique for the placement of an adjustable gastric band; in addition to offering the aforementioned benefits of such an approach, this technique facilitates later outpatient adjustment of the band. \n",
      "The diversity of clinical and occult obesity-related comorbidities necessitates a multidisciplinary team approach in the preoperative evaluation of the patient who is morbidly obese. This evaluation will enhance the postoperative outcome. Preoperative cardiac, pulmonary, psychiatric, and endocrine evaluations may be necessary. These evaluations help to exclude patients who may not benefit from surgery; at the same time, they optimize those considered being potential good candidates for surgery. Preoperative nutritional consultation helps in obtaining a detailed diet history and in explaining preoperative and postoperative diet protocol. \n",
      "See Surgical Therapy.\n",
      "After surgery, patients must remain on a high-protein, low-fat diet, and they must supplement their diet with multivitamins, iron, and calcium, usually on a twice-daily basis. Ursodiol may be given to minimize the risk of developing gallstones during the period of acute weight loss. Patients must modify their eating habits by avoiding chewy meats and other foods that may inhibit normal emptying of their stomach pouch.\n",
      "Nutritional and metabolic blood tests must be performed on a frequent basis; in the author's practice, these tests are performed at 6 months after surgery, 12 months after surgery, and then annually thereafter. \n",
      "Massive weight loss is associated with negative consequences for the body, such as flabby skin, abdominal skin overhang, and pendulous breasts. The excess skin does not contract back to its preweight gain tightness. Redundant rolls of tissue may also be associated with intertrigo and significant hygiene problems. Surgical correction of these body deformities can significantly enhance physical and physiological changes. The usual time lapse between gastric bypass and plastic surgery procedures is 12-18 months. \n",
      "Treatment alternatives for body contouring procedures include lipoplasty, conventional surgery, or a combination of the 2 procedures. Conventional contouring procedures include abdominoplasty, buttock lift, lower body lift, thigh lift, upper arm lift, facelift, breast reduction, mastopexy, and/or augmentation. Multiple procedures are usually required, and a staged approach to body contouring surgery following bariatric surgery seems to improve safety and outcomes. \n",
      "Complications of body contouring procedures include hematomas and seromas, as well as fat necrosis, skin slough, infection, and deep vein thrombosis. In addition, the patient should be involved with a team that assesses nutritional and psychological issues as needed.[29] \n",
      "For patient education resources, see the Healthy Living Center, as well as Obesity and Surgery in the Treatment of Obesity.\n",
      "Early complications of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass are as follows:\n",
      "Anastomotic leak (1-3%)\n",
      "Pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis (< 1%)\n",
      "Wound infection (more common with open approach)\n",
      "Gastrointestinal hemorrhage, bleeding (0.5-2%)\n",
      "Respiratory insufficiency, pneumonia\n",
      "Acute distention of the distal stomach\n",
      "Late complications (less frequent and less dramatic than with gastric banding) of the Roux-en-Y procedure are as follows:\n",
      "Stomal stenosis, most common (20%)\n",
      "Bowel obstruction, small bowel obstruction (1%)\n",
      "Internal hernia\n",
      "Cholelithiasis\n",
      "Micronutrient deficiencies\n",
      "Marginal ulcer\n",
      "Staple line disruption\n",
      "Ventral hernia formation (more prevalent after open approach)\n",
      "Although there is a statistical increase in the number of patients needing cholecystectomy after obesity surgery, the number is small enough to prevent suggesting a prophylactic procedure at the time of their bariatric surgery.[30] \n",
      "Risk factors associated with an increased risk of postoperative morbidity include recent myocardial infarction/angina, stroke, bleeding disorder, hypertension, and higher BMI.[31] Operative (30-day) mortality for gastric bypass when performed by skilled surgeons is about 0.5%. The risk of dying in the first month after a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass from complications of the operation is about 0.2-0.5% in expert centers. Studies have demonstrated that the mortality rate from hospitals with less experience with the procedure is far higher than that reported by expert centers. Compared with open procedures, laparoscopic gastric bypass has a higher rate of intra-abdominal complications, whereas the duration of hospitalization is shorter, wound complications are lower, and the postoperative patient comfort is higher. \n",
      "Lifelong oral or intramuscular vitamin B-12 supplementation and iron, vitamin B, folate, and calcium supplementation are recommended to avoid specific nutrient deficiency conditions, such as anemia. \n",
      "Early complications of the adjustable gastric band procedure are as follows:\n",
      "Injury of the stomach or esophagus\n",
      "Bleeding\n",
      "Food intolerance (most common immediate postoperative complication)\n",
      "Wound infection\n",
      "Pneumonia\n",
      "Late complications are as follows:\n",
      "Food intolerance or noncompliance to band (13%)\n",
      "Band slippage (stomach prolapse) (2.2-8%)\n",
      "Pouch dilatation\n",
      "Band erosion into the stomach\n",
      "Port complications\n",
      "Reoperation rate (2-41%)\n",
      "Esophageal dilatation\n",
      "Failure to lose weight\n",
      "Port infection, band infection\n",
      "Leakage of the balloon or tubing\n",
      "Mortality rate (0.5%; 0% in some series)\n",
      "Because the biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch procedure is less well known, the complications are potentially more problematic if the surgeon is unfamiliar with the procedure. \n",
      "Fat malabsorption results in diarrhea and foul-smelling gas in approximately 30% of patients.\n",
      "The potential nutritional deficiencies mandate frequent follow-up visits, with close monitoring and supplementation of multivitamins and minerals.\n",
      "Malabsorption of fat soluble vitamins (vitamins A, D, E, and K)\n",
      "Vitamin A deficiency, which causes night blindness\n",
      "Vitamin D deficiency, which causes osteoporosis\n",
      "Iron deficiency (similar incidence to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass procedure)\n",
      "Protein-energy malnutrition (may require a second operation to lengthen the common channel)\n",
      "Care of the postoperative bariatric surgery patient is recommended for the lifetime of the patient, with at least 3 follow-up visits with the bariatric surgery team within the first year. Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding requires more frequent visits for band adjustment. Postoperative dietary changes (including vitamin, mineral, and possibly liquid protein supplementation), exercise, and lifestyle changes should be reinforced by counseling, support groups, and the patient's family physician. \n",
      "Favorable outcomes of bariatric surgery can lead to socioeconomic advancement, which may require patient guidance.\n",
      "Postoperative care may also include planning for reconstructive operations after weight stabilization for certain patients.\n",
      "The Swedish Obese Subjects (SOS) study is an ongoing, prospective study of 2010 obese participants who underwent bariatric surgery and 2037 obese patients who received usual care in the primary health care system. Compared to the control group, obese adults who underwent surgery experienced a reduced number of cardiovascular deaths and a lower incidence of heart attack and stroke.[32, 33] \n",
      "Low back pain is a common complaint among obese patients. A retrospective study of morbidly obese patients who underwent bariatric surgery found that patients experienced a significant decrease in low back and radicular pain after surgery, which led to improvements in quality of life. Patients also experienced a marked increase in the L4-5 intervertebral disc height.[34] \n",
      "An Australian study by Keating et al compared the results of weight-loss treatments in patients who had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus in class I/II obesity, estimating the lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for individuals who had undergone surgically induced weight loss and for patients who had utilized conventional weight loss treatment.[35] \n",
      "The investigators found that the mean length of time for diabetes remission over a lifetime was 11.4 years for patients who had undergone surgical treatment and 2.1 years for patients who had utilized conventional therapy. Over the remainder of their lifetime, patients in the surgical therapy group lived 15.7 discounted QALYs, compared with 14.5 discounted QALYs for patients in the conventional therapy group. For surgical and conventional therapy patients, the mean discounted lifetime costs were, respectively, 98,900 and 101,400 Australian dollars per patient (1 Australian dollar = 0.74 US dollars). Compared with conventional therapy, surgically induced weight loss was associated with a mean health care saving of 2,400 Australian dollars and with 1.2 additional QALYs per patient.\n",
      "In another study, Keating and coauthors looked at the within-trial cost efficacy, over 2 years, of surgical treatment relative to that of conventional therapy for achieving remission in patients recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus with class I/II obesity.[36] Trial intervention costs included gastric banding surgery, mitigation of complications, outpatient medical consultations, medical investigations, pathology, weight-loss therapies, and medication.\n",
      "An incremental cost-effectiveness analysis demonstrated that the mean 2-year intervention costs per patient were 13,400 Australian dollars for surgical therapy and 3,400 Australian dollars for conventional therapy; laparoscopic adjustable gastric band (LAGB) surgery was responsible for 85% of the difference. For surgical patients, outpatient medical consultation costs were 3-fold greater than those for conventional patients, but medication costs were 1.5 times higher for patients who underwent conventional therapy. The cost differences occurred primarily in the trial's first 6 months. In relation to conventional treatment, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for surgical therapy was 16,600 Australian dollars per case of diabetes remitted.\n",
      "An updated Cochrane review from 2014 that included 22 trials with 1798 participants concluded that surgical treatment of obesity yielded greater improvement in weight loss and weight-associated comorbidities than nonsurgical interventions did, regardless of the type of procedure,[37] though certain procedures were associated with greater weight loss and fewer comorbidities than others.\n",
      "In this review, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy had comparable outcomes, and both had better outcomes than adjustable gastric banding.[37] In very-high-BMI patients, biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch yielded better weight loss than RYGB did. Outcomes were comparable for duodenojejunal bypass with sleeve gastrectomy and laparoscopic RYGB. Isolated sleeve gastrectomy led to better weight loss than adjustable gastric banding. Weight-related outcomes were similar for laparoscopic gastric imbrication and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy.\n",
      "In general, with all 22 studies taken into account, rates of adverse events and reoperation were not well reported.[37] Because the follow-up period in most of the trials reviewed was only 1 or 2 years, the long-term effects of bariatric surgery could not be definitively established. \n",
      "Over the past 10 years, the field of bariatric surgery has been enriched by data from numerous clinical investigations and experience. The direction of future clinical investigations is manifold and includes the following: \n",

      "Regional anesthesia is increasing in its utility in the treatment of injuries, foreign body removal, and even in the operative setting. By providing a regional block, the affected anatomy can be properly cleaned, explored, and treated without causing unnecessary pain to the patient. In many settings, regional anesthetic is also preferred because it prevents the distortion of the anatomy commonly seen in local anesthesia. \n",
      "Regional anesthesia of the ankle presents a challenge to the provider because of the complicated nerve supply to the foot and the varied locations of the nerves around the ankle. However, by adequately anesthetizing the foot, patients can be offered relief from often painful injuries while the complex anatomy of the foot is examined and repaired. See Ankle Joint Anatomy for more information. \n",
      "Providing local anesthesia to the foot, particularly to the sole, presents many difficulties. First, the thick but sensitive skin must be penetrated with a needle, which often must be a larger gauge than might be used elsewhere to pass through the skin — this can be very painful. Second, the underlying soft tissue of the sole is tightly bound to the fascia and does not separate easily; injecting even small amounts of anesthesia locally into the sole can result in compression of blood vessels and vascular damage to the tissue that is already injured. But, with regional anesthesia, each of these difficulties can be avoided by blocking the pain sensation carried from the foot at the point where the nerves pass through a safe, readily accessible region of anatomy.[1] \n",
      "An image depicting a cross-section of the ankle can be seen below.\n",
      "Five main nerves originate from the major nerve roots of the lower extremity innervating the foot (see the image below). The dorsal aspect of the foot is innervated by 3 nerves that run on the anterior side of the lower leg and ankle — the superficial peroneal, deep peroneal, and saphenous nerves. The volar aspect of the foot is innervated by the posterior tibial and sural nerves on the posterolateral aspect of the ankle. Complete regional anesthesia of the foot requires blocking each of the 5 nerves.[2, 1] \n",
      "The most commonly used short-acting subcutaneous anesthetic agent is Lidocaine, which can be given as 1% or 2% mixtures. Epinephrine 1:1000 may be added to both 1% and 2% solutions. Epinephrine is typically added to local anesthetic to cause vasoconstriction, prolonging the activity of the anesthetic and limiting bleeding. \n",
      "The time between injection and onset of anesthesia with lidocaine is approximately 60-90 seconds, and the effects of lidocaine typically last 20-30 minutes (up to 2 hours if mixed with epinephrine). The maximum dose of lidocaine in adults is 300 mg (3-4 mg/kg in children), when mixed with epinephrine, the maximum dose is 500 mg (7 mg/kg).\n",
      "Bupivacaine 0.25% or 0.5% (Marcaine, Sensorcaine) is a common long-acting anesthetic agent. The time of onset of these long-acting agents is approximately 10-20 minutes, but the anesthetic effects last 4-6 hours alone, and up to 8 hours when mixed with epinephrine. The maximum dose of bupivacaine is 175 mg (2 mg/kg) in an adult, but this is increased to 225 mg (3 mg/kg) when mixed with epinephrine.\n",
      "50/50 or 25/75 mixtures of lidocaine and bupivacaine may provide the most optimal anesthetic for certain ankle anesthesia, providing nearly immediate relief from pain from the short-acting component, and providing up to 8 hours of anesthesia from the long-acting medication. Because regional anesthesia is administered some distance away from the wound site, and also because epinephrine should be used with great caution in distal extremities, anesthetic medications mixed with vasoconstrictors such as epinephrine are not recommended in ankle anesthesia.\n",

      "All injections should be performed under sterile conditions, with the area of injection cleaned with iodine or chlorhexidine. The size of the syringe varies depending on the amount of anesthetic given (keep in mind maximum doses), but all injections should be given with the smallest needle possible in an effort to cause the least pain. A 25-gauge needle is small enough to provide little trauma to the skin and is an excellent choice for administration of anesthesia. \n",
      "The superficial peroneal nerve provides sensation to most of the dorsum of the foot and the dorsal aspect of each of the toes and web spaces, with the exception of the lateral portion of the great toe and the medial side of the second toe, and corresponding web space. The nerve passes subcutaneously on the anterolateral side of the ankle. \n",
      "To block this nerve, palpate the extensor hallucis longus tendon and the lateral malleolus. Insert the needle just over the lateral malleolus and tunnel the needle subcutaneously toward the extensor hallucis longus tendon. Complete anesthesia of the superficial peroneal nerve is achieved by placing 5-7 mL of anesthesia in a band-like pattern between these 2 points (see image below).[2, 1] \n",
      "As with the administration of any anesthetic, care must be taken to draw back on the syringe before injecting medication to prevent intravascular administration.\n",
      "The deep peroneal nerve provides sensation to the lateral portion of the great toe and medial side of the second digit, as well as the web space between the 2. This distribution is commonly referred to as the “flip-flop” nerve because it innervates the area surrounding the thong of a sandal. This nerve runs deeper in the ankle than the superficial peroneal nerve, hidden behind the extensor hallucis longus tendon. \n",
      "To provide anesthesia to the “flip-flop” region, first palpate the anterior tibial tendon and the extensor hallucis longus tendon by having the patient dorsiflect the foot and great toe. Insert the needle between these 2 tendons approximately 1 cm superior to the medial malleolus. Draw back to prevent intravascular administration of medication, then deposit 1 mL of anesthetic. Once beyond the extensor hallucis longus tendon, angle the needle toward the lateral malleolus and insert until the tip of the needle rests against the anterior tibia (1-2 cm). Remove the needle 1-2 mm so the tip is not resting against the bone, draw back, and then deposit 5 mL of anesthetic to the deep peroneal nerve (see image below).[2, 1] \n",
      "The saphenous nerve provides sensation to the skin on the medial aspect of the foot along the arch and runs alongside the saphenous vein between the medial malleolus and the anterior tibial tendon. \n",
      "To anesthetize the arch of the patient’s foot, palpate the anterior tibial tendon and the medial malleolus, and place 3-5 mL of anesthetic in a subcutaneous wheal between these 2 landmarks (see image below).[2, 1] \n",
      "The posterior tibial nerve is the largest in the ankle and branches into the medial and lateral plantar nerves in the foot, supplying sensation to the entire volar surface, as well as providing motor innervation to the intrinsic muscles of the foot. It runs deep to the posterior tibial artery. \n",
      "To anesthetize the sole of a patient’s foot, palpate the posterior tibial artery between the medial malleolus and the achilles tendon. Insert the needle 1 cm superior to the medial malleolus just posterior to the artery with the needle angled toward the lateral malleolus (see image below). Pass the needle until it rests on the posterior aspect of the tibia, then withdraw 1-2 mm, aspirate the syringe to prevent intravascular administration, and place 5-7 mL of anesthetic. An alternative to passing the needle to the posterior tibia is to insert the needle 1-2 cm and wiggle the tip of the needle; paresthesia elicited by movement of the needle tip indicate contact with the posterior tibial nerve.[2, 1] \n",
      "The sural nerve supplies sensation to the lateral and medial aspects of the foot. It passes between the lateral malleolus and the achilles tendon. \n",
      "Anesthesia is provided to the sural nerve by first palpating the achilles tendon and the lateral malleolus. Insert the needle 1 cm superior to the lateral malleolus and deposit 5 mL in a band-shaped pattern between the 2 landmarks (see the image below).[2, 1] \n",
      "Anesthesia of the posterior tibia nerve may cause loss of sympathetic tone to the vascular supply of the foot resulting in vasodilation. The effect of this vasodilation is increased warmth in the foot and may also result in an increase in blood loss to an injury on the volar aspect of the foot. \n",
      "Advise patients to pay special attention and care to the anesthetized foot while the affected limb is numb.\n",
      "Avoid re-injecting nerves once anesthesia medication is administered.\n",
      "Very few contraindications to local or regional anesthesia of the ankle exist. Injection of local anesthetic should never be performed through infected tissue.\n",

      "Nonbacterial cystitis is a catchall term that encompasses various medical disorders, including infectious and noninfectious cystitis, as well as painful bladder syndrome/interstitial cystitis (PBS/IC). PBS/IC describes a syndrome of pain and genitourinary symptoms (eg, frequency, urgency, pain, dysuria, nocturia) for which no etiology can be found. There are many controversies regarding nonbacterial cystitis, including possible etiologic agents, methods of diagnosis, and treatment, especially for noninfectious causes. \n",
      "Infectious nonbacterial cystitis includes the following forms of the disease:\n",
      "Viral\n",
      "Mycobacterial\n",
      "Chlamydial\n",
      "Fungal\n",
      "Schistosomal\n",
      "Candidal infection of the bladder is shown in the image below.\n",

      "Chemical\n",
      "Autoimmune\n",
      "Hypersensitivity\n",
      "General symptoms of cystitis include urgency, frequency, dysuria, and, occasionally, hematuria, dyspareunia, abdominal cramps, and/or bladder pain and spasms. Establishing or excluding a specific diagnosis often requires repeated cultures and various urologic procedures, including cystoscopy with bladder biopsies, various bladder tests, and immune system function examinations. Some conditions, such as carcinoma in situ, bladder calculi, and urethral foreign bodies, may result in symptoms that mimic those of nonbacterial cystitis. \n",

      "The images below demonstrate the anatomy of the female pelvis, the gross anatomy of the bladder, and the muscles of the pelvic floor that may be involved in nonbacterial cystitis.\n",
      "The pathophysiology of the disorder depends on its etiology.\n",
      "Advances in understanding the pathophysiology of complex pain syndromes have demonstrated growth of bridging neurons in the dorsal horns of the spinal cord between the type C pain fibers and the type A pain fibers, indicating perception of pain started by stimulus that is usually nonpainful. \n",
      "Another example of neural cross-talk is an experiment in rats that demonstrated increased muscle spasm in the bladder with colonic irritation and in the colon with bladder irritation. This may help to explain the concomitant occurrences of irritable bowel syndrome, pelvic pain syndrome, and interstitial cystitis.[1] \n",
      "\n",
      "Viruses\n",
      "\n",
      "Cytopathologic viruses, such as herpes simplex virus–1 (HSV-1) and HSV-2, live integrated into the host genome in the nervous system. Impairment of immune surveillance, which can be caused by comorbid diseases, drugs, or chronic activation of the neuroendocrine pathways involved with corticosteroid production, allow the virus to activate, travel down the peripheral nerves, and cause an outbreak of the disease. Viruses normally do not cause cystitis in immunocompetent adults. In a given patient, however, whether the infection is due to primary infection or reactivation of latent virus is unclear. \n",
      "\n",
      "Chlamydia\n",
      "\n",
      "Chlamydiae are obligate, intracellular parasites with a unique reproductive cycle that involves 2 forms: (1) an extracellular form adapted to survival in the environment, which allows the infection to be transmitted from one person to another, and (2) an intracellular form that replicates and produces more extracellular forms. Chlamydia trachomatis is the organism most commonly identified; in addition to cystitis, it can cause the following disorders: \n",
      "Urethritis\n",
      "Cervicitis\n",
      "Pelvic inflammatory disease\n",
      "Proctitis\n",
      "Epididymitis\n",
      "\n",
      "Mycobacteria\n",
      "\n",
      "Initial infection with mycobacteria generally elicits a mild inflammatory response with few or no symptoms. Weeks after the primary infection, with continued replication of the bacilli, development of cell-mediated immunity leads to macrophage infiltration and ingestion of the pathogen. \n",
      "While mycobacteria can persist within macrophages, replication usually ceases, and spread of the disease is contained. Individuals with disturbances in cell-mediated immune responses are therefore at higher risk for dissemination of the infection. \n",
      "\n",
      "Other infections\n",
      "\n",
      "Fungal infections can occur in immunocompetent hosts, but they are more likely to occur in individuals with abnormal immune systems. Species of fungi associated with urogenital fungal infections include Blastomyces dermatitidis, Candida species, and Torulopsis glabrata. \n",
      "Schistosomiasis can cause symptoms of cystitis, including frequency, urgency, and dysuria. Schistosoma eggs are deposited within the bladder wall as part of their life cycle. An eosinophilic immune reaction is generated in response to the eggs, leading to chronic inflammation. Chronic schistosomiasis can eventually result in small bladder capacity, obstructive uropathy, and bladder cancer. \n",
      "Radiation cystitis is presumably due to the ionizing radiation administered for treatment for pelvic and urogenital cancers. In a study by Perez et al,[2] the volume of space irradiated and the total dose of radiation were important factors that influenced morbidity. Patients treated with stationary radiation portals that delivered higher doses of radiation to the bladder had a significantly higher incidence of morbidity than did patients treated with rotating portals (18% vs 5%, respectively). \n",
      "Eosinophilic cystitis has been associated with various etiologic factors, such as allergies, bladder tumors, and parasitic infections, which stimulate antigen formation, leading to antigen-antibody complexes that stimulate inflammatory cascades. This, in turn, leads to eosinophil infiltration and chemokine release, causing fibrosis.[3] \n",
      "Chemical cystitis, which is due to chemotherapy with alkylating agents such as cyclophosphamide, is thought to be due to metabolites excreted in the urine. The effects appear to be related to the dose and duration of therapy. \n",
      "Viruses normally do not cause cystitis in immunocompetent adults. Improved molecular detection techniques have allowed the recognition of viral infections, such as the following, in immunocompromised patients: \n",
      "BK polyomavirus infections[4] \n",
      "Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections (associated with hemorrhagic cystitis after bone marrow transplantation[5, 6] ) \n",
      "Adenovirus infections[7] \n",
      "Herpes and chlamydial cystitis are sexually transmitted, while other types, such as fungal cystitis, occur mainly in immunocompromised hosts.[8, 9] Corynebacterium urealyticum has been associated with a very rare chronic inflammatory disorder, encrusted cystitis, which is characterized by precipitation and encrustation of phosphate ammonium magnesium salts on the bladder mucosa.[10] Yeast infiltration of the bladder is shown in the image below.\n",
      "Schistosomiasis (shown in the image below) can cause severe cystitis and lower urinary tract symptoms, due to an inflammatory reaction to Schistosoma eggs embedded in the host's bladder.\n",
      "Cystitis may occur following radiation therapy to the pelvis for cancer treatment. The average time from the beginning of radiation therapy to initial symptoms can be several months to several years. Symptoms can include anything from mild bleeding to severe, recurrent bleeding and pain requiring hospitalization for treatment. \n",
      "Autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or Sjögren syndrome can also be associated with irritative bladder symptoms, such as frequency or pain. Eosinophilic cystitis is a rare pathologic condition characterized by transmural inflammation of the bladder predominantly by eosinophils and fibrosis, with or without muscle necrosis.[3] \n",
      "Cystitis may also be caused by chemicals and medications. Intravenous and oral cyclophosphamide, used to treat malignancies and vasculitides (eg, SLE, Wegener granulomatosis) can cause hemorrhagic cystitis.[11] Low-dose methotrexate, used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, has also been reported to cause hemorrhagic cystitis.[12] \n",
      "Reports have documented cystitis arising after the recreational abuse of ketamine, an anesthetic agent. Such cases are characterized by marked frequency, urgency, and dysuria and display cystoscopic evidence of inflammation throughout the bladder.[13] \n",
      "The frequency of viral and herpetic cystitis is unclear because culture results can be falsely negative. For example, it has been proposed that both HSV-1 and HSV-2 may initially cause asymptomatic infections, so the incidence of herpetic cystitis may be higher than culture-positive results indicate. \n",
      "Hemorrhagic cystitis due to adenoviral infections is common in immunocompromised hosts, especially bone marrow transplant recipients or those with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Hemorrhagic cystitis due to infection with adenoviruses or BK polyomavirus has been reported in 20% and 8% of pediatric bone marrow transplant patients, respectively. \n",
      "The frequency of chlamydial genitourinary infections may also be higher than cultures indicate. A study of 130 patients aged 14-25 years in an urban outpatient clinic demonstrated a 21% frequency of C trachomatis infection; one third were asymptomatic. Risk factors for Chlamydia infection in this group included younger age, more than one sexual partner, and international travel. In another study, of 36 cases of bladder biopsies performed to evaluate cystitis, antigen from C trachomatis was detected by immunochemistry in one third of the specimens. \n",
      "Mycobacterial cystitis or urogenital tuberculosis is more common in underdeveloped countries and continues to be a major urologic problem in places such as North Africa, mainly because of diagnosis delays. The tuberculosis vaccine, bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), which may be instilled into the bladder to treat bladder tumors, has also been reported to cause cystitis. \n",
      "Fungal cystitis, most commonly due to Candida species,[14] is more common in immunocompromised hosts, such as those with diabetes mellitus, those who have received chemotherapy, older subjects, women, and those with indwelling catheters who have received multiple courses of antibiotics. \n",
      "Schistosomiasis most frequently occurs in the developing world, although it is estimated that 400,000 cases exist in the United States. There are five different species of schistosomes; Schistosoma haematobium often causes urinary tract infections.[15] \n",
      "Radiation cystitis was reported to occur in 6.5% of 1784 patients treated with a combination of external beam and intracavitary radiotherapy for stage Ib carcinoma of the cervix. Perez et al reported moderate-to-severe cystitis occurring in 12% of 738 patients treated with definitive irradiation therapy for prostate cancer after 10 years.[2] \n",
      "Autoimmune disease related to cystitis is another entity that may be more common than previously realized. A review in Sweden demonstrated that 17% of all patients diagnosed with interstitial cystitis had rheumatoid arthritis, 47% had hypersensitivity reactions or allergies, and 2.3% had either ulcerative colitis or Crohn disease, a rate more than 30 times the prevalence rate in the general population. \n",
      "Both Sjögren syndrome and SLE have been associated with urinary symptoms. In one study by Haarala et al of 121 patients and 121 age- and sex-matched controls, more than 60% of patients had some urinary symptoms, compared with 20% of controls.[16] \n",
      "Infectious causes of nonbacterial cystitis, such as HSV-1 or HSV-2, can be treated; however, the treatment does not eliminate the dormant virus integrated into the host genome, so the disease can recur. \n",
      "Both chlamydial and mycobacterial infections can be cured. For chlamydial disease, cure is not protective and the disease can be reacquired. In addition, while mycobacterial infections can generally be cured with regimens containing 3 or 4 drugs, a review by Mnif et al of 60 cases of urogenital tuberculosis found that only 2 were cured by medical therapy alone.[17] \n",
      "Of the remaining patients, 54 required one of the following surgical interventions:\n",
      "Nephrectomy (43 patients)\n",
      "Ureterovesical reimplantation (7)\n",
      "Augmentation enterocystoplasty (11)\n",
      "Other ureteral diversions (5)\n",
      "Two patients whose medical status and nutritional status were poor to begin with died despite aggressive therapy.\n",
      "Fungal infections are usually curable, depending on the underlying health status of the patient. Because patients with severe immunosuppression (eg, those with untreatable malignancies, AIDS, poorly controlled diabetes, transplant recipients) are the ones most likely to develop these infections, some patients may require continued treatment to ensure that the infection does not recur. \n",
      "Radiation cystitis, when it does occur, is usually mild and does not require specific therapy.[18] However, the incidence of bleeding, scarring, and/or obstruction increases over time, and symptoms may occur for the first time many years after the radiation treatment. Some patients with heavy bleeding, strictures, or obstruction may require urinary diversion surgery for symptom relief.[19] \n",
      "Chemical cystitis due to chemotherapy agents is generally mild, with no long-term consequences, and resolves when the medications are stopped. No known cures exist for autoimmune disease–associated cystitis, but symptoms can often be controlled with anti-inflammatory agents or corticosteroids. Eosinophilic cystitis often recurs despite resection of the lesion and anti-inflammatory treatments, so long-term follow-up is required.[3] \n",
      "Chronic pelvic pain syndrome is a common and debilitating condition of multifactorial etiology, including social, psychological, and biologic factors. This is a diagnosis of exclusion, after other etiologies of pelvic pain have been eliminated from the differential.[20] \n",
      "\n",
      "Viruses\n",
      "\n",
      "Viral infections are often difficult to diagnose, and viral culture results can be falsely negative. Some viruses can be detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay or by detection of antibodies to the virus. Also, Chlamydia can be difficult to grow, and chlamydial culture results may be falsely negative. Chlamydia infection can also be diagnosed by cell cytology, enzyme-linked immunoassays, and PCR assay. Of all of these tests, PCR assay is probably the most reliable.[21] \n",
      "\n",
      "Mycobacteria\n",
      "\n",
      "Prior mycobacterial infection, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, can be detected by intracutaneous injection of a dose of intermediate-strength, tuberculin-purified protein derivative. The test is considered positive if an induration of at least 10mm develops at the injection site within 48-72 hours. An assay has been developed that quantifies interferon-gamma released from T cells sensitized to tuberculosis antigens (the QuantiFERON test); the second-generation assay uses antigens almost completely specific for M tuberculosis and can be performed using whole blood samples. \n",
      "Mycobacteria can also be detected with examination of tissue stained with the acid-fast dye carbolfuchsin as slender, curved, polychromatic, beaded rods in pairs or small clumps. Growing the bacteria on highly selective media allows cultivation within 1-2 weeks, although identification and antibiotic sensitivity testing may take longer.\n",
      "Finally, mycobacterial infection can be detected with PCR assay. In a study by Moussa et al, the sensitivity of acid-fast bacilli (AFB) staining was 52% versus 96% for PCR assay, when compared with cultures.[22] \n",
      "Intravenous urography remains the primary imaging modality for mycobacterial cystitis, although ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT) scanning, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may also be used. However, all imaging findings may be normal in early disease. For more information, see the Medscape Reference article Imaging of Tuberculosis in the Genitourinary Tract. \n",
      "\n",
      "Other infections\n",
      "\n",
      "Fungal infection can be indicated by the findings of hyphae and/or spores on microscopic evaluation of wet smears or histopathologic sections or by culture. Microbiologic diagnosis of funguria is based on a fungal concentration of more than 103/µL in the urine.[23] Some fungi, such as Candida species, grow on many media, while others, such as Blastomyces dermatitidis, require specialized culture techniques. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) probes for detection of numerous fungal infections by PCR assay are also available.[24] \n",
      "Schistosomal infection is detected by searching for terminally spined eggs in urinary sediment. Histopathologic analysis can also be performed with a squash preparation on a glass slide. Urinary, urethral, and/or vaginal or prostatic cultures can also be performed. Special stains or PCR assays for viruses, chlamydia, fungi, and mycobacteria should be included in selected patients. \n",
      "The diagnosis of cystitis due to radiation therapy, chemicals, or autoimmune disease can be established in part by obtaining the relevant history. In patients with radiation cystitis, associated urinary tract infections are not uncommon. Cystoscopy may be required to exclude other causes of bleeding, such as recurrent tumor, a new primary tumor, or benign prostatic hyperplasia. Cystoscopy with biopsy is the criterion standard for diagnosing eosinophilic cystitis.[3] Some patients may also have peripheral eosinophilia. \n",
      "Diagnosis of autoimmune diseases relies on a compatible history supported by serologic or tissue confirmation. Detection of antinuclear antibodies (ANA) is often used as a screening test for connective tissue disease; positive test results are subjected to assays that are more specific.\n",
      "Serologic tests likely to be positive in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) include low C3, anti–double stranded (ds) DNA, anti-Smith (Sm), and antiribonucleoprotein (anti-RNP) antibodies. In patients with SLE and bladder involvement, abdominal CT scanning may demonstrate thickening of the bladder wall, hydronephrosis, ascites, and bowel-wall thickening.[25] \n",
      "Biopsy of other affected organs may show vasculitis. Tests likely to have positive results in patients with Sj ö gren syndrome include the Schirmer tear test, anti-Ro(SS-A) and anti-La(SS-B), and minor lacrimal gland biopsy. Urine cytology can be a useful first step in the diagnosis of genitourinary malignancies. \n",
      "Treatment of nonbacterial cystitis addresses the specific cause. Noninfectious etiologies that require separate consideration are radiation cystitis, chemical cystitis, autoimmune cystitis, and interstitial cystitis. For treatment options in painful bladder syndrome/interstitial cystitis, see the Medscape Reference article Interstitial Cystitis. Surgical treatment is rarely needed for nonbacterial cystitis. \n",
      "With infectious cystitis, the cause may be viral, chlamydial, mycobacterial, schistosomal, or fungal. Most infectious cases are treated with systemic and, in some cases, local pharmacotherapy. If the patient is taking immunosuppressive medication, the treatment regimen may need to be adjusted. \n",
      "Some types of infectious, recurrent, nonbacterial cystitis are being treated with transfer factor (TF) specific for the kind of infection (Candida, herpes). De Vinci and associates demonstrated a marked decrease in the number of recurrences in females treated with TF for this disorder.[26] \n",
      "Treatment for immunocompetent adults with cystitis from herpes simplex virus–1 (HSV-1) or HSV-2 includes acyclovir 400mg 5 times daily for 7 days or valacyclovir 500mg twice daily for 5-10 days. Acyclovir requires dose adjustment for patients with a decreased glomerular filtration rate. \n",
      "Ganciclovir and vidarabine have been used in some cases of hemorrhagic cystitis from cytomegalovirus (CMV) or adenovirus in patients who have undergone bone marrow transplantation.[27, 28] Valganciclovir is an oral prodrug with greater intestinal absorption than ganciclovir. \n",
      "Cystitis due to BK polyomavirus reportedly resolved without treatment in 9 pediatric patients. However, in adults who have undergone renal transplantation, cidofovir and a decrease in the dose of immunosuppressants are usually recommended, because of the concern of renal parenchymal damage from the virus. Mycophenolate mofetil has been associated with more adenoviral infections than azathioprine. \n",
      "Treatment regimens for cystitis caused by Chlamydia include the following:\n",
      "Doxycycline, 100mg twice daily for 7 days\n",
      "Azithromycin, 1g orally as a single dose\n",
      "Erythromycin, 500mg 4 times daily for 7 days\n",
      "A fluoroquinolone (eg, ofloxacin, 300mg twice daily for 7 days)\n",
      "Erythromycin, azithromycin, and amoxicillin can also be used in pregnant women.\n",
      "Mycobacterial treatment begins with 3 or 4 agents, generally including isoniazid (INH) and rifampin (RIF), depending on the probable sensitivities of the organism and the underlying state of the immune system. A standard regimen is as follows: \n",
      "INH 300mg/day\n",
      "RIF 600 mg once daily\n",
      "Ethambutol (EMB) 15mg/kg/day\n",
      "Pyrazinamide 2g/day\n",
      "Other drugs that can be used include streptomycin 0.75-1g/day, ethionamide (ETH) 1g/day, or one of the fluoroquinolones. Treatment regimens are modified when the actual drug sensitivities are determined. Drug toxicities sufficient to require a change in regimen occur in up to 5% of patients. \n",
      "Surgery is rarely needed to treat tuberculosis of the genitourinary system. When surgery is necessary, complex reconstruction is often required.\n",
      "Treatment is recommended only when the funguria is symptomatic or in cases of fungal colonization when host factors increase the risk of fungemia.[23] Fungal cystitis in immunocompetent patients with indwelling catheters may respond to removal of the catheter without further treatment of the infection. If removal of the catheter is not an option, treatment with oral azole antifungal agents or bladder irrigations containing amphotericin B 50mcg/mL for 5 days can be instituted. \n",
      "In immunosuppressed patients, another option may be intravenous amphotericin B, depending on the degree of dissemination of the infection. Azole antifungal agents are often not effective against Candida species.[14] Testing for susceptibility to antifungal agents may be necessary if patients have previously received therapy for fungal infections. Measures to reduce risk factors include removing urinary catheters; limiting antibiotic treatment; and, in patients with diabetes, optimizing management of glycemia.[23] \n",
      "Echinocandins (eg, caspofungin, micafungin), a newer class of agents that are active against azole- and polyene-resistant fungi, are a possible alternative. One trial that compared caspofungin with amphotericin B for invasive candidiasis demonstrated similar efficacy and markedly fewer side effects for caspofungin. Some infectious disease specialists consider caspofungin to be first-line therapy against invasive non-albicans candidal species. Micafungin can often be used against fungi that are resistant to azole antifungal agents. \n",
      "If bladder outlet obstruction is suspected in the setting of severe funguria, a Foley catheter or suprapubic tube can be placed. After resolution of the infection, benign prostatic hyperplasia should be managed surgically. \n",
      "All patients with schistosomiasis should be treated, regardless of disease severity.[29] The current recommended treatment for schistosomiasis is 2 oral doses of praziquantel 40mg/kg for 1 day. This regimen results in cure rates of 83-100%. \n",
      "Surgery should be reserved for cases that do not respond to medical therapy or for patients with intractable gross hematuria. Schistosomiasis can cause large granulomas in the bladder, which may warrant surgical extirpation. \n",
      "Obstructive uropathy due to ureteral strictures is the most common sequela. Management of ureteral stricture is based on the stricture length and location. Deep, nonhealing bladder ulcers may require partial cystectomy, while biopsy-proven bladder cancer often requires radical cystectomy. \n",
      "While minor bleeding episodes due to radiation treatment stop without treatment, severe bleeding may require hospitalization for therapy. Clot evacuation and continuous bladder irrigation are the standard treatment for heavy bleeding. A small number of patients with severe bleeding require further treatment. Methods that have been tried include hyperbaric oxygen therapy and chemical therapy. Urinary diversion surgery is the surgical treatment of choice in patients whose symptoms fail to resolve.[30, 31, 32] \n",
      "In a study by Del Pizzo et al of long-term results of hyperbaric oxygen in 11 patients, 3 had complete resolution of symptoms, 3 had persistent symptoms, and 5 had initial improvement but then relapsed.[33] In a review by Chong et al of hyperbaric oxygen therapy in 60 patients with radiation cystitis, 80% had complete or partial resolution of the hematuria, and 96% (27 of 28) of patients treated within 6 months of the onset of hematuria had complete resolution of symptoms.[34] \n",
      "Srisupundit and colleagues reported good short-term results (follow-up, 1-9mo) in 13 of 20 patients treated with an intravenous infusion of a chemically stabilized chlorite matrix tetrachlorodecaoxygen (TCDO).[35] \n",
      "Chemical cystitis from chemotherapy agents, such as cyclophosphamide, may resolve with hydration or with discontinuation of the drug. Another alternative is mesna, a semisynthetic sulfhydryl compound that reacts chemically with the drug metabolites that cause urotoxicity, detoxifying them in a manner similar to the physiologic cysteine-cystine system. \n",
      "Ballen and colleagues suggested that extremely aggressive hydration with intravenous fluids and diuretics to maintain a urine output greater than 150mL/h may be as effective a therapy as mesna, as well as being much less expensive.[36] \n",
      "Treatment of autoimmune diseases generally relies on a combination of symptomatic relief, anti-inflammatory drugs, and immunosuppressive agents. In the last several years, monoclonal antibodies to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)–alpha and several of the interleukins have markedly improved symptoms in some of the rheumatic diseases. The greater variety of immunologic targets amenable to treatment modification has allowed rheumatologists to tailor combinations of drugs to yield improved efficacy with fewer symptoms. \n",
      "At present, no therapy for eosinophilic cystitis is curative. Treatments that have been tried include anti-inflammatory therapies with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and steroids and transurethral resection of the bladder lesion.[3] Other anti-inflammatory agents are under investigation, such as IPD-1151T, an immunoregulatory agent that suppresses T cell–mediated cytokines responsible for immunoglobulin-E (IgE) production and eosinophilia, as well as interleukin-4 (IL-4) and IL-5. \n",
      "The goals of pharmacotherapy are to eradicate the infection, to reduce morbidity, and to prevent complications. Depending on the cause, the agents used may include antimicrobials, antifungals, antivirals, anthelmintics, or antidotes.\n",
      "A combination of the antibiotics isoniazid (INH), rifampin (RIF), ethambutol, and pyrazinamide are commonly used to treat mycobacterial cystitis, while oral fluconazole or bladder irrigations containing amphotericin B can be used against fungal cystitis.\n",
      "The antiviral agents acyclovir and valacyclovir are administered for the treatment of cystitis caused by herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) or HSV-2. Ganciclovir and the prodrug valganciclovir are employed against hemorrhagic cystitis caused by cytomegalovirus (CMV).\n",
      "Praziquantel kills the parasites responsible for schistosomiasis, with the current recommended therapy being 2 oral doses of praziquantel 40mg/kg for 1 day; this regimen has an 83-100% cure rate. \n",
      "Empiric antimicrobial therapy must be comprehensive and should cover all likely pathogens in the context of the clinical setting.\n",
      "Rifampin inhibits ribonucleic acid (RNA) synthesis in bacteria by binding to the beta subunit of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, which in turn blocks RNA transcription. The dosage in adults is 600mg orally once daily for 6 months. Rifampin induces microsomal enzymes, which may decrease the effects of other drugs. Blood pressure may increase with coadministration of enalapril. Coadministration with isoniazid or pyrazinamide may result in a higher rate of hepatotoxicity than with either agent alone (discontinue 1 or both agents if alterations in liver function test results occur).\n",
      "Obtain complete blood counts (CBCs) and baseline clinical chemistries prior to and throughout rifampin therapy. In liver disease, weigh the benefits of rifampin use against the risk of further liver damage. Interruption of therapy and high-dose, intermittent therapy are associated with thrombocytopenia that is reversible if therapy is discontinued as soon as purpura occurs; if treatment is continued or resumed after the appearance of purpura, cerebral hemorrhage or death may occur. Rifampin is a pregnancy category C drug. \n",
      "Isoniazid is an isonicotinic acid hydrazide. This agent is used as part of a triple-drug regimen. The adult dosage is 300 mg orally once daily for 6 months. Previous isoniazid-associated hepatic injury or other severe adverse reactions are contraindications. Daily alcohol ingestion may predispose patients to isoniazid-related hepatitis.\n",
      "Aluminum salts may decrease isoniazid serum levels (administer 1-2 hours before taking aluminum salts). Isoniazid may increase anticoagulants' effects with coadministration and may inhibit the metabolic clearance of benzodiazepines. Carbamazepine toxicity or isoniazid hepatotoxicity may result from concurrent use (monitor carbamazepine concentrations and liver function).\n",
      "Coadministration with cycloserine may increase central nervous system (CNS) side effects (eg, dizziness). Acute behavioral and coordination changes may occur with coadministration of disulfiram. Coadministration with rifampin after halothane anesthesia may result in hepatotoxicity and hepatic encephalopathy.\n",
      "Isoniazid may inhibit hepatic microsomal enzymes and increase toxicity of hydantoin. Monitor patients with active chronic liver disease or severe renal dysfunction; periodic ophthalmologic examinations during isoniazid therapy are recommended even when visual symptoms do not occur. Isoniazid is a pregnancy category C drug. \n",
      "Pyrazinamide is used only in combination with other effective antituberculous agents. Its mechanism of action is unknown. It is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and hydrolyzed to its active metabolite in the liver. Note that 70% is excreted in urine within 24 hours.\n",
      "Treat patients with drug-resistant disease with individualized regimens. The adult dose is 2g orally once daily for 2 months. Contraindications include severe hepatic damage and acute gout. Coadministration with rifampin may result in a higher rate of hepatotoxicity than with either agent alone (discontinue if alterations in liver function test results occur).\n",
      "Pyrazinamide inhibits the renal excretion of urates and may result in hyperuricemia (usually asymptomatic). Perform baseline serum uric acid determinations, and discontinue the drug upon signs of hyperuricemia with acute gouty arthritis. Perform baseline liver function tests (closely monitor in liver disease) and discontinue the drug if signs of hepatocellular damage appear. Observe caution when there is a history of diabetes mellitus. Pyrazinamide is a pregnancy category C drug. \n",
      "Ethambutol diffuses into actively growing mycobacterial cells, such as tubercle bacilli. It impairs cell metabolism by inhibiting synthesis of 1 or more metabolites, which in turn causes cell death. No cross-resistance has been demonstrated. Mycobacterial resistance is frequent with previous therapy. Use in these patients in combination with previously unadministered second-line drugs.\n",
      "The adult dosage of ethambutol is 15mg/kg orally once daily for 2 months. Aluminum salts may delay and reduce absorption (give several hours before or after ethambutol dose). Reduce the dose in patients with impaired renal function. Optic neuritis may develop but is reversible if the drug is promptly discontinued. Ethambutol is a pregnancy category C drug. \n",
      "Doxycycline is a broad-spectrum, synthetically derived, bacteriostatic antibiotic in the tetracycline class. It is almost completely absorbed, concentrates in bile, and is excreted in urine and feces as a biologically active metabolite in high concentrations.\n",
      "It inhibits protein synthesis and, thus, bacterial growth by binding to 30S and, possibly, 50S ribosomal subunits of susceptible bacteria. It may block dissociation of peptidyl transfer RNA (tRNA) from ribosomes, causing RNA-dependent protein synthesis to arrest. The adult dosage is 100mg orally twice daily. Severe hepatic dysfunction is a contraindication.\n",
      "The bioavailability of doxycycline decreases with antacids containing aluminum, calcium, magnesium, iron, or bismuth subsalicylate. Tetracyclines can increase the hypoprothrombinemic effects of anticoagulants and can decrease the efficacy of oral contraceptives, causing breakthrough bleeding and increased risk of pregnancy. Photosensitivity may occur with prolonged exposure to sunlight or tanning equipment.\n",
      "Reduce the dose in patients with renal impairment. Consider drug serum level determinations in prolonged therapy. Tetracycline use during tooth development (the last half of pregnancy through age 8 years) can permanently discolor teeth. Fanconi-like syndrome may occur with outdated tetracyclines. Doxycycline is a pregnancy category D drug. \n",
      "Azithromycin is used to treat mild to moderate microbial infections. In adults, it is given in a single dose of 1g orally. Azithromycin acts by binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit of susceptible microorganisms and blocks dissociation of peptidyl tRNA from ribosomes, causing RNA-dependent protein synthesis to arrest. Nucleic acid synthesis is not affected. It concentrates in phagocytes and fibroblasts, as demonstrated by in vitro incubation techniques. In vivo studies suggest that the concentration in phagocytes may contribute to drug distribution to inflamed tissues.\n",
      "Contraindications to azithromycin use include hepatic impairment. Do not administer with pimozide. Azithromycin may increase the toxicity of theophylline, warfarin, and digoxin; effects are reduced with coadministration of aluminum and/or magnesium antacids.\n",
      "Nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity may occur when this agent is coadministered with cyclosporine. Site reactions can occur when it is given by the IV route. Bacterial or fungal overgrowth may result from prolonged antibiotic use.\n",
      "Azithromycin may increase hepatic enzymes and cholestatic jaundice. Use this agent with caution in patients with impaired hepatic function or prolonged QT intervals. Azithromycin is a pregnancy category B drug. \n",
      "Ofloxacin penetrates the prostate well and is effective against Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis. It is a pyridine carboxylic acid derivative with a broad-spectrum bactericidal effect. The adult dosage is 300mg orally twice daily for 7 days.\n",
      "Antacids, iron salts, and zinc salts may reduce serum levels. Patients should take antacids 2-4 hours before or after taking fluoroquinolones. Cimetidine may interfere with the metabolism of fluoroquinolones.\n",
      "Ofloxacin may increase the toxicity of theophylline, caffeine, cyclosporine, and digoxin (monitor digoxin levels) and may increase the effects of anticoagulants (monitor the prothrombin time). In prolonged therapy, periodically evaluate organ system functions (eg, renal, hepatic, hematopoietic). Adjust the dose in patients with impaired renal function. Superinfections may occur with prolonged or repeated antibiotic therapy. Ofloxacin is a pregnancy category C drug. \n",
      "The mechanism of action of antifungal agents may involve an alteration of RNA and DNA metabolism or an intracellular accumulation of peroxide that is toxic to the fungal cell. \n",
      "Amphotericin B is produced from a strain of Streptomyces nodosus. The antifungal activity of amphotericin B results from its ability to insert itself into the fungal cytoplasmic membrane at sites containing ergosterol or other sterols. Aggregates of amphotericin B accumulate at sterol sites, resulting in an increase in cytoplasmic membrane permeability to monovalent ions (eg, potassium, sodium).\n",
      "At low concentrations, the main effect of this agent is increased intracellular loss of potassium, resulting in reversible fungistatic activity; however, at higher concentrations, pores of 40-105nm in the cytoplasmic membrane are produced, leading to large losses of ions and other molecules.\n",
      "A second effect of amphotericin B is its ability to cause auto-oxidation of the cytoplasmic membrane and the release of lethal free radicals. The main fungicidal activity of amphotericin B may reside in its ability to cause auto-oxidation of cell membranes. The adult dose is 0.5mg/kg intravenously once daily for 7-14 days; 50mcg/mL can be given as bladder irrigation continuously for 5 days.\n",
      "Antineoplastic agents may enhance the potential of amphotericin B for renal toxicity, bronchospasm, and hypotension. Corticosteroids, digitalis, and thiazides may potentiate hypokalemia. The risk of renal toxicity is increased with cyclosporine. Monitor renal function, serum electrolytes (eg, magnesium, potassium), liver function, CBCs, and hemoglobin concentrations. Resume therapy at the lowest dose level (eg, 0.25mg/kg) when therapy is interrupted for more than 7 days.\n",
      "Hypoxemia, acute dyspnea, and interstitial infiltrates may occur in neutropenic patients receiving leukocyte transfusions (give amphotericin infusions at different times than leukocyte transfusions). Fever and chills are not uncommon after the first few doses of the drug. Rare acute reactions may include hypotension, bronchospasm, arrhythmias, and shock. Amphotericin B is a pregnancy category B drug.\n",
      "Fluconazole is a synthetic oral antifungal (broad-spectrum bistriazole) that selectively inhibits fungal cytochrome P-450 and sterol C-14 alpha-demethylation; this prevents the conversion of lanosterol to ergosterol, thereby disrupting cellular membranes. The drug has little affinity for mammalian cytochromes, which is believed to explain its low toxicity.\n",
      "Fluconazole is available in tablet form for oral administration, as a powder for oral suspension, and as a sterile solution for intravenous use. It has fewer adverse effects and better tissue distribution than older systemic imidazoles. The adult dosage is 200mg orally or intravenously once daily for 7-14 days. Probenecid, zidovudine, or cimetidine coadministration prolongs the half-life and increases CNS toxicity. Adjust the dose for renal insufficiency; closely monitor if rashes develop, and discontinue the drug if lesions progress.\n",
      "Fluconazole may cause clinical hepatitis, cholestasis, and fulminant hepatic failure (including death) in patients with certain underlying medical conditions (eg, AIDS, malignancy) or in those taking multiple, concomitant medications. It is not recommended for breastfeeding mothers.\n",
      "The convenience and efficacy of a single-dose regimen for treatment of vaginal yeast infections should be weighed against the difficulties resulting from the higher incidence of adverse reactions reported with oral fluconazole versus intravaginal agents. Fluconazole is a pregnancy category C drug. \n",
      "Nucleoside analogues are initially phosphorylated by viral thymidine kinase to eventually form a nucleoside triphosphate. These molecules inhibit HSV polymerase with 30-50 times the potency of human alpha-DNA polymerase. \n",
      "Acyclovir is activated via phosphorylation by virus-specific thymidine kinase. Guanylate kinase converts the monophosphate form into diphosphate and triphosphate analogues that inhibit viral DNA replication. Acyclovir has affinity for viral thymidine kinase and, once phosphorylated, causes DNA-chain termination when acted on by DNA polymerase.\n",
      "Acyclovir inhibits the activity of HSV-1 and HSV-2. Patients experience less pain and faster resolution of cutaneous lesions when this agent is started within 48 hours of rash onset. It may prevent recurrent outbreaks. Early initiation of therapy is imperative. The adult dosage is 400mg orally 5 times daily for 7 days.\n",
      "Concomitant use of probenecid or zidovudine prolongs the half-life and increases the CNS toxicity of acyclovir. Use this agent with caution in patients with renal failure or those using nephrotoxic drugs. Acyclovir is a pregnancy category B drug.\n",
      "Valacyclovir is a prodrug that is rapidly converted to the active drug acyclovir. It is more expensive than acyclovir but has a more convenient dosing regimen. The adult dosage is 500mg orally twice daily for 5-10 days.\n",
      "The risk of hyperkalemia is increased in patients taking angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, cyclosporine, and potassium-sparing diuretics. Use valacyclovir with caution in patients with renal failure (decrease the dose) and in patients who are also taking nephrotoxic drugs. Valacyclovir is associated with the onset of hemolytic uremic syndrome. Valacyclovir is a pregnancy category B drug.\n",
      "Valganciclovir is an L-valyl ester prodrug of ganciclovir used for CMV disease prophylaxis in various solid organ transplants. Ganciclovir is a synthetic analogue of 2'-deoxyguanosine, which inhibits replication of human CMV in vitro and in vivo. Viral activity is halted due to the inhibition of viral DNA synthesis.\n",
      "This agent has the advantage of once- or twice-daily oral administration. It achieves serum levels comparable to those obtained with intravenous ganciclovir. The adult dosage is 450mg orally twice daily for 21 days. Contraindications include severe renal dysfunction or hemodialysis, pregnancy, breastfeeding, or an absolute neutrophil count of less than 500 cells/µL, a platelet count of less than 25,000/µL, or a hemoglobin level of less than 8g/dL.\n",
      "Interactions with valganciclovir are similar to those reported with ganciclovir. Coadministration with cytotoxic drugs such as dapsone, vinblastine, doxorubicin, pentamidine, flucytosine, vincristine, amphotericin B, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole combinations, or other nucleoside analogues may result in additive toxicity of rapidly dividing cell populations, including bone marrow, spermatogonia, germinal layers of skin, and GI mucosa. Coadminister with these agents only if the benefits outweigh the risks.\n",
      "Coadministration with imipenem-cilastatin may cause generalized seizures (use only if the benefits outweigh the risks). Serum creatinine levels may increase following concurrent use of ganciclovir with either cyclosporine or amphotericin B. In the presence of probenecid, ganciclovir renal clearance is reduced; bioavailability may increase when didanosine is administered either 2 hours before or simultaneously with ganciclovir.\n",
      "The bioavailability of ganciclovir may decrease in the presence of zidovudine, while the bioavailability of zidovudine is increased in the presence of ganciclovir.\n",
      "Strict adherence to dosage guidelines of valganciclovir is essential to avoid overdose. Valganciclovir tablets may not be substituted for ganciclovir capsules on a one-to-one basis; adjust the dose according to the creatinine clearance (CrCl) in patients with impaired renal function.\n",
      "Valganciclovir may cause granulocytopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. It is not indicated for CMV disease prevention in liver transplantation (the incidence of CMV disease in liver transplant recipients is higher with valganciclovir than with ganciclovir). Valganciclovir is a pregnancy category C drug. \n",
      "The biochemical pathways of schistosomes are sufficiently different from those of the human host to allow selective interference by chemotherapeutic agents in relatively small doses. \n",
      "Praziquantel increases cell membrane permeability in susceptible worms, resulting in the loss of intracellular calcium, massive contractions, and paralysis of musculature. In addition, it produces vacuolization and disintegration of schistosome tegument. This is followed by attachment of phagocytes to the parasite and death.\n",
      "Tablets should be swallowed whole with some liquid during meals. Keeping the tablets in the mouth may reveal their bitter taste, which can produce nausea or vomiting. The adult dosage is 40mg/kg orally twice daily for 1 day.\n",
      "Ocular cysticercosis is a contraindication. Hydantoins may reduce serum praziquantel concentrations, possibly leading to treatment failures.\n",
      "Destruction of parasites within the eyes can cause irreparable lesions (ocular cysticercosis should not be treated with praziquantel). Patients should use caution while driving or performing other tasks requiring alertness on the day of treatment and on the following day. Minimal increases in liver enzymes have been reported. When schistosomiasis or fluke infection is associated with cerebral cysticercosis, hospitalize the patient for duration of treatment. Praziquantel is a pregnancy category B drug. \n",
      "These agents counteract the toxic effects of drugs.\n",
      "In the kidney, mesna disulfide is reduced to free mesna. Free mesna has thiol groups that react with acrolein, the ifosfamide and cyclophosphamide metabolite considered responsible for urotoxicity. It inactivates acrolein and prevents urothelial toxicity without affecting cytostatic activity. The adult dosage is 240mg intravenously at 0, 4, 8 hours after the ifosfamide or cyclophosphamide dose.\n",
      "Mesna may increase warfarin effects. Mesna does not prevent hemorrhagic cystitis in all patients (monitoring for hematuria in the morning prior to ifosfamide or cyclophosphamide dose is required). It does not prevent or alleviate other toxicities associated with ifosfamide or cyclophosphamide. Common adverse effects include hypotension, headache, GI toxicity, and limb pain. Mesna is a pregnancy category B drug.\n",

      "Serum (red top tube, SST)\n",
      "Plasma (green top tube - sodium heparin, ammonium heparin, lithium heparin; PST)\n",
      "Whole blood - newborn screening, collected by heel puncture 48-72 hours after birth\n",

      "Specimen stability:\n",
      "Centrifuge specimens and remove serum or plasma from the cells within 2 hours of collection.\n",
      "Store at room temperature for 8 hours, or refrigerate at 2-8 degrees Celsius (36-46 degrees Fahrenheit) up to 5 days.\n",
      "If assays are not completed within 48 hours, or the separated sample is to be stored beyond 48 hours, samples should be frozen at -20 degrees Celsius or colder. Frozen samples should be thawed only once. Analyte deterioration may occur in samples that are repeatedly frozen or thawed.\n",

      "Measurement of TSH\n",
      "\n",
      "There are two major ways in which TSH is currently evaluated: Radioimmunoassay (RIA) and chemiluminescence immunoassays.\n",
      "In the RIA, endogenous TSH present in the sample is competing with radiolabeled TSH for a limited amount of TSH-specific antibodies (“competitive assay”). The measured signal is inversely proportional with the amount of TSH present in the sample.[2] \n",
      "The chemiluminescence assay is using two antibodies (“sandwich immunoassay”). The “capture antibody” is binding usually within the alpha subunit of TSH, while the “detection antibody” is always binding within the TSH-specific beta-subunit. The measured signal is directly proportional with the amount of TSH present in the sample. The chemiluminescence assay is significantly more sensitive than RIA; the current generation of immunometric assay (the fourth generation) has a functional detection limit of 0.001-0.002 mIU/L.[2] \n",
      "As with all immunoassays, these assays are prone to specific interferences, especially heterophilic antibodies. Hook effect is rarely seen. Macro TSH can also be considered in the face of spurious results that do not match the clinical conditions and if other interferences are eliminated as well.\n",
      "Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is produced by the adenohypophysis. It promotes development of the thyroid gland and maintenance of its normal function. TSH stimulates the thyroid to produce and release the thyroid hormones: T4 and T3 (hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis). Measurement of TSH frequently is included with that of T4 and T3 in a laboratory panel to screen for and to evaluate thyroid disease. The diagnosis of thyroid disorders can be complex, requiring the combined results of thyroid testing.[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 2] \n",

      "Patients with neurological disease require special management considerations. These include pretreatment treatment planning, therapeutic techniques, and posttreatment requirements. Neurologic conditions facing the dentist include abnormalities associated with the cranial nerves, facial sensory loss, facial paralysis, and conditions such as epilepsy, Parkinson disease, multiple sclerosis, stroke, and myasthenia gravis. In this article, strategies for managing patients with some of these conditions are presented.[1] \n",
      "Epilepsy describes a set of conditions associated with paroxysmal neurologic function observed as seizures that include convulsive and other neurosensory disturbances. About 10% of the population is estimated to have epilepsy. The clinical signs associated with tonic-clonic convulsions are quite distinctive and can be disconcerting to dental personnel when confronted with the situation while the patient is in the dental chair. To eliminate potential treatment issues, guidelines are presented below.[2, 3, 4, 5] \n",
      "Ensure the patient has been compliant with medication coverage. If there are any questions regarding compliance, contact the patient’s physician. \n",
      "Ascertain that the patient has no toxicity with the medication taken and that mental function is normal.\n",
      "Patients taking valproic acid (Depakene) may have increased bleeding during procedures. If there are acknowledged problems, order a bleeding time assessment prior to treatment and consult with a physician if the values are questionable. \n",
      "During dental treatment, be aware that a grand mal seizure could occur. If a seizure occurs, place the chair back to a supine position, turn the patient to the side, and keep the patient comfortable without restraint until it has passed. Placement of a tongue blade is not recommended unless the patient is aware of an impending seizure and can assist in its placement. \n",
      "If injury to the lip or tongue occurs during a seizure, appropriate treatment such as suturing of lacerations, localization of potential fractures, removal of fragments, and follow-up dental treatment is required. \n",
      "If dental treatment necessitates the replacement of one or more missing teeth, restoration of the missing teeth using fixed appliances is preferable over removal-type prosthetics. In addition, the clinician needs to be cognizant of potential fracture of anterior full-coverage restorations such as complete porcelain crowns. It may be preferable to use three-quarter gold crowns with porcelain veneers if concern exists regarding the frequency of seizures. \n",
      "Monitor gingival hyperplasia secondary to the use of anticonvulsant medication (eg, phenytoin).\n",
      "Monitor oral hygiene and provide educational information and training to facilitate the patient’s ability to manage his or her oral health effectively; evidence suggests meticulous oral hygiene may reduce or prevent gingival hyperplasia. \n",
      "Subluxation of the temporomandibular joint can occur during seizure episodes. No specific treatment is necessary unless this results in joint hypermobility and subsequent frequent nonseizure subluxation. \n",
      "A neurovascular accident (stroke) is often fatal but may be precipitated by multiple non–life-threatening events that if identified, can reduce the risk of an acute and serious outcome when the patient is in dental treatment. Knowing the clinical signs and symptoms of a stroke is important in managing older patients with longstanding cardiovascular disease.[6, 7, 8, 9, 10] \n",
      "The clinician should be aware that patients with longstanding hypertension and cerebrovascular disease are at increased risk of a cerebrovascular accident. Stroke is the third most common cause of death in the United States. \n",
      "The signs of a stroke can be quite subtle. A major event may be associated with many transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), or minor strokes, that last for a few minutes. In a TIA, dizziness, diplopia, hemiplegia, and altered speech may occur. A thorough history of possible patient symptoms prior to treatment may provide useful information regarding the possibility of an impending major event during treatment, as several TIAs occurring close together often precede a major stroke. This is important because the clinician should be aware that a patient experiencing a minor event in the office may have a major event after leaving the office, leading to mortality. \n",
      "The warning signs of a severe stroke event include sudden or temporary weakness or numbness of the face and other body parts, loss of speech or difficulty speaking or understanding speech, visual changes, and unexplained loss of balance or dizziness. \n",
      "In patients with an identified increased risk of stroke pretreatment or who exhibit signs of a mild TIA occurring during treatment, a follow-up phone call is recommended. Any patient exhibiting signs or symptoms of a TIA or stroke requires immediate medical referral. \n",
      "If an obvious stroke has occurred during a dental procedure, the patient’s airway must be maintained until emergency medical personnel arrive. \n",
      "In patients who have experienced physical deficits (eg, hand-eye coordination problems, arm or hand deficit, masticatory muscle weakness), personal oral hygiene efforts may be compromised. Treatment planning should include the following: \n",
      "Comprehensive oral hygiene instruction that may include instruction on use of an electric toothbrush or a large hand-held toothbrush or water irrigation instrument coupled with plaque-revealing tablets; running a washcloth through the vestibule can help to reduce accumulation of food matter \n",
      "Recommendation regarding anticaries preparations, including rinses containing fluoride and xylitol or the use of xylitol lozenges (eg, XyliMelts) to help reduce the oral bacterial burden of Streptococcus mutans\n",
      "The possible need for an antifungal prescription, as the accumulation of saliva in patients with facial palsy may be problematic at the corners of the mouth and can predispose the patient to fungal infection \n",
      "Awareness that depending on the type of stroke, the poststroke patient may have been prescribed anticoagulant medication\n",
      "Parkinson disease, resulting from the degeneration of cells in the substantia nigra, causes a number of motor symptoms that can complicate dental management. These include tremors, involuntary movements, facial and limb rigidity, bradykinesia (particularly as it relates to swallowing), and akathisia (ie, restlessness). During dental treatment, these disabilities must be taken into consideration. Following is a list of specific recommendations for managing the dental patient with Parkinson disease.[10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15] \n",
      "The same oral hygiene information should be offered to the Parkinson disease patient as the stroke patient. Recommend the use of an electric toothbrush or a large hand-held toothbrush or water irrigation instrument coupled with plaque-revealing tablets. Running a washcloth through the vestibule can help to reduce accumulation of food matter. \n",
      "Patients with Parkinson disease may not be able to effectively communicate their needs, so a family member or caregiver should be present when the treatment plan is presented to the patient. If there is cognitive decline, this is particularly important to ensure understanding in full of the risks and benefits of proposed intervention (eg, multiple extractions, periodontal treatment). \n",
      "Severe tremors and involuntary jaw and limb movements can present difficulty in the management of the patient. This is particularly true for the patient in whom the medication dosage is incorrect or in whom medication has not been completely effective. To gain the maximum benefit from prescribed drugs, patients should be instructed to take prescribed medication as scheduled, and dentistry appointments should be made within a short time frame following their use. \n",
      "Since facial musculature tonicity associated with Parkinson disease can lead to the patient’s inability to express emotion, it is important for the treating clinician to be sympathetic and attentive to eye or other limb movements that could suggest pain during a procedure. \n",
      "Bradykinesia that causes swallowing difficulty is also a potential problem for Parkinson disease patients during treatment. Adequate suction of fluid is imperative during dental procedures, including those involving dental hygiene. \n",
      "Temperature regulation may be compromised if the patient has comorbid Shy-Drager disease (an abnormality of the autonomic nervous system); placement of a blanket over the patient may help maintain warmth. \n",
      "Dental reconstruction that involves the occlusal surfaces needs to be tailored to the fact that bruxism may be severe in patients with Parkinson disease. The occlusion of placed restorations should be kept as flat as possible to avoid breakage of the restoration or teeth. \n",
      "Care should be taken to not overstress the patient with Parkinson disease. Short appointments are helpful.\n",
      "The patient with Parkinson disease may have difficulty placing an oral sleep-apnea appliance. This approach to the management of sleep apnea is discouraged. If apnea is a confounding problem, medical consultation is required and use of a continuous positive-airway pressure (CPAP) device should be considered. \n",
      "Some Parkinson patients develop temporomandibular joint problems, particularly hypermobility of the mandible and frequent subluxation. This is a difficult problem to treat if the patient also has comorbid severe bruxism. In some cases, patients benefit from Herbst appliances with strong elastics worn at night. However, the problem of patient placement in the face of muscle rigidity and bradykinesia is also a concern in these cases. \n",
      "Myasthenia gravis results in generalized muscle weakness, including the muscles of the face, tongue, and neck. Patients with myasthenia gravis may hold their jaws in a slack position with the mouth open. The problem becomes worse towards the end of the day and with fatigue or stress.[16, 17, 18, 19, 20] \n",
      "Dental treatment should be scheduled at a time when the patient is not fatigued, and preferably during remission of the disease. Appointments need to be made 1-2 hours after the patient has taken his or her medication (an anticholinesterase, eg, pyridostigmine), preferably in the morning. \n",
      "Consideration should be made for reducing stress prior to and during the dental appointment. Anxious patients may benefit from a low dose of an anxiolytic benzodiazepine such as such as diazepam (Valium) or lorazepam (Ativan) taken prior to treatment. \n",
      "Procaine anesthetics should not be used for local anesthesia.\n",
      "In the patient with a dental abscess, only the antibiotics penicillin or erythromycin can be safely used to treat infection. Drugs to be avoided include the tetracyclines, clindamycin, lincomycin, sulphonamides, and aminoglycosides. For pain, paracetamol coupled with a narcotic (eg, codeine) may be helpful. Aspirin has been associated with cholinergic crisis in patients taking anticholinesterases, so it should be avoided. \n",
      "Since patients with myasthenia gravis often have impaired respiration, special consideration needs to be taken for maintaining oxygenation during procedures involving conscious sedation. In fact, it is best to treat these patients in an inpatient hospital setting. The drugs often used in conscious sedation (eg, opioids, barbiturates) may potentiate or aggravate breathing difficulty in myasthenia gravis patients. \n",
      "Conditions causing loss of function of the seventh cranial nerve include multiple sclerosis, infection (eg, syphilis, HIV disease, Lyme disease, leprosy), sarcoidosis, cholesteatoma, Bell palsy, and several intracranial problems (eg, tumor, trauma). Upper and lower motor neuron abnormality can be differentiated by the resulting loss of function. Many of these conditions affect oral health.[21, 22, 23, 24, 25] \n",
      "Loss of taste can occur and is associated with abnormality of the chorda tympani.\n",
      "In cases involving Bell palsy, the corneas should be protected during dental treatment.\n",
      "In other cases of facial palsy, there may be accumulation of food debris, potentially increasing dental plaque. Patients should be instructed in techniques to be used after eating aimed at eliminating the material. \n",
      "Leaking of saliva at the corners of the mouth may predispose the patient to angular cheilitis. An antifungal cream appropriately placed may be useful if fungal infection emerges. \n",
      "Placement of a splint may be helpful in improving facial aesthetics. Other approaches may include appliances anchored to the teeth. Suturing may also be useful. \n",
      "Pain in the region of the ear/temporomandibular joint may be the result of inflammation of the geniculate ganglia of the facial nerve. Avoidance of misdiagnosis (temporomandibular joint pathology) is important. \n",
      "Facial dyskinesias can lead to tongue or jaw movement that can confound dental treatment. Bruxism can lead to tooth wear or fracture. Patients with facial dyskinesias may benefit from predental treatment prescription of a benzodiazepine. \n",
      "Sensory deficits associated with conditions involving the fifth cranial nerve may be the result of conditions such as Paget disease or peripheral lesions involving the bones and the canals. \n",
      "Brain stem lesions can affect mastication and cause mouth-opening difficulty.\n",
      "Facial paralysis can result from alveolar nerve blocks. In some cases, this can be permanent.\n",

      "Creatinine clearance is a widely used value to estimate the glomerular filtration rate (GFR).[1] GFR equals the sum of the filtration rates in all of the functioning nephrons; thus, the GFR gives a rough count of the number of functioning nephrons. \n",
      "Decrease in creatinine clearance indicates decreased GFR and impaired renal function.[2] This can be due to conditions (eg, progressive renal disease)[3] or can result from an adverse effect of renal hypoperfusion, which is often reversible, and can result from drug effects, hypotension, volume depletion, heart failure, and shock.[4, 5, 6] \n",
      "Increased creatinine clearance is often called hyperfiltration and is usually seen during pregnancy or in patients with diabetes mellitus before diabetic nephropathy has occurred. It may also occur with large dietary protein intake or with plasma volume expansion.[7] \n",

      "Note: samples with gross hemolysis and gross lipemia are rejected.\n",
      "Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is most commonly assessed via creatinine clearance. The test requires measurement of serum creatinine, urine creatinine, and 24-hour urine volume. Creatinine is a product of the metabolism of dietary meat and creatine in skeletal muscle. With the exception of extreme muscle exertion or muscle breakdown (rhabdomyolysis), creatinine has a stable plasma concentration and is released into the circulation at a relatively constant rate. \n",
      "Creatinine is freely filtered across the glomerulus; the kidney does not reabsorb or metabolize creatinine. The proximal tubules secrete approximately 15% of urinary creatinine in patients with a normal GFR. In patients with declining renal function, a progressively higher percentage is secreted. The net effect is progressive overestimation of the GFR, with more severe loss of renal function. \n",
      "Ignoring proximal tubular secretion, all of the filtered creatinine (the GFR product and the serum creatinine concentration) is excreted (equal to product of the urine creatinine concentration [UCr] and the urine flow rate or volume [V]). \n",
      "This can be expressed as follows:\n",
      "GFR x serum creatinine concentration = UCr x V\n",
      "GFR = [UCr x V]/serum creatinine concentration\n",
      "The formula provides the creatinine clearance; however, this formula tends to overestimate the real GFR by approximately 15% percent.[9] This overestimate was offset by older colorimetric assays, which also overestimated serum creatinine owing to noncreatinine chromogens. Newer assay methods have mostly abolished the serum error, resulting in a larger discrepancy between creatinine clearance and GFR. \n",
      "To maximize accuracy, the creatinine clearance is usually determined from a 24-hour urine collection. Shorter-timed collections are less accurate owing to bladder retention and variability in creatinine excretion. See the formula below: \n",
      "Creatinine clearance - 70-135 mL/min/surface area (surface area)\n",
      "In adults younger than 50 years, daily creatinine clearance is 20-25 mg/kg ideal body weight in males and 15-20 mg/kg ideal body weight in females. In adults older than 50 years, daily creatinine clearance decreases progressively owing to reduction in muscle mass. \n",
      "If the GFR suddenly decreases by 50%, the kidneys transiently filter and excrete only half as much creatinine, causing accumulation of creatinine in the body fluids and raising plasma concentrations. Plasma concentrations of creatinine continue to rise until the filtered load of creatinine (PCr × GFR) and creatinine excretion (UCr × V) return to normal and a balance between creatinine production and creatinine excretion is reestablished. \n",
      "If the GFR falls to one fourth of normal, plasma creatinine increases to about 4 times normal and a decrease of the GFR to one eighth of normal would raise plasma creatinine to 8 times normal. Thus, under steady-state conditions, the creatinine excretion rate equals the rate of creatinine production, despite reductions in the GFR. However, this normal rate of creatinine excretion occurs at the expense of elevated plasma creatinine concentration.[10] \n",
      "Ideally, inulin clearance is an accurate measure of GFR/creatinine clearance. It is freely filtered and not reabsorbed or secreted by the kidneys. However, the main limiting factor is to administer it intravenously.[10] \n",
      "Other substances that can be used are radioactive iothalamate creatinine.[10] \n",
      "The combined creatinine–cystatin C equation performed better than equations based on either of these markers alone and may be useful as a confirmatory test for chronic kidney disease.[11] \n",
      "To assess renal function using the GFR\n",
      "Accurate results depend on accurately timed and complete collection. Incomplete urine collections result in underestimation of creatinine excretion and, therefore GFR. \n",
      "One of the major limitations of creatinine clearance testing is that it becomes less accurate as the GFR declines because of increasing tubular secretion of creatinine. This results in the GFR being overestimated. \n",
      "Sex and race can alter creatinine clearance. Women have lower serum creatinine values because they have less muscle mass and a lower rate of creatinine production. Lower values for Latinos and higher values for blacks probably indicate greater and lesser muscle mass and creatinine production, respectively. \n",
      "Creatinine production differs over time. Individuals with significant variations in dietary intake (eg, vegetarian diet, creatine supplementation) or reduction in muscle mass (eg, amputation, muscle wasting, malnutrition) produce different amounts of creatinine than the general population. Amputees have reduced creatinine production proportional to the amount of muscle removed (eg, a lower extremity is more significant than an upper extremity). \n",
      "Some drugs can increase the serum creatinine level by decreasing creatinine secretion. These drugs include trimethoprim (which is usually combined with sulfamethoxazole)[12] and the H2-blocker cimetidine, which results in a self-limited and reversible increase in the serum creatinine level by as much as 0.4-0.5 mg/dL. \n",
      "In advanced kidney failure, extrarenal intestinal creatinine elimination increases. The serum creatinine concentration is lower than would be expected from the GFR as a result of the intestinal bacterial overgrowth and increased bacterial creatininase activity. \n",
      "The colorimetric serum creatinine assay (alkaline picrate method) cross-reacts with noncreatinine chromogens, particularly acetoacetate in patients with diabetic ketoacidosis. In these patients, serum creatinine can be falsely elevated by 0.5 mg/dL to more than 2 mg/dL. The drugs cefoxitin and flucytosine cause a similar effect. \n",

      "Hyponatremia is defined as a serum sodium level of less than 135 mEq/L and is considered severe when the serum level is below 125 mEq/L. Many medical illnesses, such as congestive heart failure, liver failure, renal failure, or pneumonia, may be associated with hyponatremia.\n",
      "Symptoms range from nausea and malaise, with mild reduction in the serum sodium, to lethargy, decreased level of consciousness, headache, and (if severe) seizures and coma. Overt neurologic symptoms most often are due to very low serum sodium levels (usually < 115 mEq/L), resulting in intracerebral osmotic fluid shifts and brain edema.\n",
      "Hyponatremia is classified according to volume status, as follows:\n",
      "Hypovolemic hyponatremia: decrease in total body water with greater decrease in total body sodium\n",
      "Euvolemic hyponatremia: normal body sodium with increase in total body water\n",
      "Hypervolemic hyponatremia: increase in total body sodium with greater increase in total body water\n",

      "Isotonic hyponatremia\n",
      "Hypertonic hyponatremia\n",
      "See Clinical Presentation for more detail.\n",
      "There are three essential laboratory tests in the evaluation of patients with hyponatremia that, together with the history and the physical examination, help to establish the primary underlying etiologic mechanism: urine osmolality, serum osmolality, and urinary sodium concentration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Urine osmolality\n",
      "\n",
      "Urine osmolality helps differentiate between conditions associated with impaired free-water excretion and primary polydipsia. A urine osmolality greater than 100 mOsm/kg indicates impaired ability of the kidneys to dilute the urine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Serum osmolality\n",
      "\n",
      "Serum osmolality readily differentiates between true hyponatremia and pseudohyponatremia. The latter may be secondary to hyperlipidemia or hyperproteinemia, or may be hypertonic hyponatremia associated with elevated glucose, mannitol, glycine (posturologic or postgynecologic procedure), sucrose, or maltose (contained in IgG formulations).\n",
      "\n",
      "Urinary sodium concentration\n",
      "\n",
      "Urinary sodium concentration helps differentiate between hyponatremia secondary to hypovolemia and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH). With SIADH (and salt-wasting syndrome), the urine sodium is greater than 20-40 mEq/L. With hypovolemia, the urine sodium typically measures less than 25 mEq/L. However, if sodium intake in a patient with SIADH (or salt-wasting) happens to be low, then urine sodium may fall below 25 mEq/L.\n",
      "See Workup for more detail.\n",
      "Hypotonic hyponatremia accounts for most clinical cases of hyponatremia and can be treated with fluids. Acute hyponatremia (duration < 48 hours) can be safely corrected more quickly than chronic hyponatremia. The treatment of hypertonic and pseudohyponatremia is directed at the underlying disorder in the absence of symptoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "Intravenous fluids and water restriction\n",
      "\n",
      "Administer isotonic saline to patients who are hypovolemic to replace the contracted intravascular volume. Patients with hypovolemia secondary to diuretics may also need potassium repletion, which, like sodium, is osmotically active.\n",
      "Treat patients who are hypervolemic with salt and fluid restriction, plus loop diuretics, and correction of the underlying condition. The use of a V2 receptor antagonist may be considered.\n",
      "For euvolemic, asymptomatic hyponatremic patients, free water restriction (< 1 L/day) is generally the treatment of choice. There is no role for hypertonic saline in these patients.\n",
      "When treating patients with overtly symptomatic hyponatremia (eg, seizures, severe neurologic deficits), hypertonic (3%) saline should be used.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pharmacologic treatment\n",
      "\n",
      "Conivaptan, a V1A and V2 vasopressin receptor antagonist, is available only for intravenous use and is approved for use in the hospital setting for euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia. It is contraindicated in hypovolemic patients. It induces both a water and sodium diuresis with improvement in plasma sodium levels.\n",
      "See Treatment and Medication for more detail.\n",
      "Hyponatremia is an important and common electrolyte abnormality that can be seen in isolation or, as most often is the case, as a complication of other medical illnesses.\n",
      "Sodium is the dominant extracellular cation and cannot freely cross the cell membrane. Its homeostasis is vital to the normal physiological function of cells. The normal serum sodium level is 135-145 mEq/L. Hyponatremia is defined as a serum level of less than 135 mEq/L and is considered severe when the serum level is below 125 mEq/L. Joint European guidelines classify hyponatremia in adults as follows[1, 2] :\n",
      "This article reviews the epidemiology, pathophysiology, differential diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of this disorder.[3, 4] \n",
      "Hypoosmolality (serum osmolality < 280 mOsm/kg) always indicates excess total body water relative to body solutes or excess water relative to solute in the extracellular fluid (ECF), as water moves freely between the intracellular and the extracellular compartments. This imbalance can be due to solute depletion, solute dilution, or a combination of both.\n",
      "Under normal conditions, renal handling of water is sufficient to excrete as much as 15-20 L of free water per day. Further, the body's response to a decreased osmolality is decreased thirst. Thus, hyponatremia can occur only when some condition impairs normal free water excretion.[5] Generally, hyponatremia is of clinical significance only when it reflects a drop in the serum osmolality (ie, hypotonic hyponatremia), which is measured directly via osmometry or is calculated as 2(Na) mEq/L + serum glucose (mg/dL)/18 + BUN (mg/dL)/2.8. Note that urea is not an effective osmole, so when the urea levels are very high, the measured osmolality should be corrected for the contribution of urea.\n",
      "The recommendations for treatment of hyponatremia rely on the current understanding of CNS adaptation to an altered serum osmolality. In the setting of an acute drop in the serum osmolality, neuronal cell swelling occurs due to the water shift from the extracellular space to the intracellular space (ie, Starling forces). Swelling of the brain cells elicits the following two osmoregulatory responses:\n",
      "It inhibits both arginine vasopressin secretion from neurons in the hypothalamus and hypothalamic thirst center. This leads to excess water elimination as dilute urine.\n",
      "There is an immediate cellular adaptation with loss of electrolytes, and over the next few days, there is a more gradual loss of organic intracellular osmolytes.[6] \n",
      "Therefore, correction of hyponatremia must take into account the chronicity of the condition. Acute hyponatremia (duration < 48 h) can be safely corrected more quickly than chronic hyponatremia. Correction of serum sodium that is too rapid can precipitate severe neurologic complications. Most individuals who present for diagnosis, versus individuals who develop it while in an inpatient setting, have had hyponatremia for some time, so the condition is chronic, and correction should proceed accordingly.\n",
      "The incidence of hyponatremia depends largely on the patient population and the criteria used to establish the diagnosis. Among hospitalized patients, 15-20% have a serum sodium level of <135 mEq/L, while only 1-4% have a serum sodium level of less than 130 mEq/L. The prevalence of hyponatremia is lower in the ambulatory setting.\n",
      "Severe hyponatremia (< 125 mEq/L) has a high mortality rate. In instances when the serum sodium level is less than 105 mEq/L, the mortality is over 50%, especially in alcoholics.[7] In patients with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction, the presence of hyponatremia on admission or early development of hyponatremia is an independent predictor of 30-day mortality, and the prognosis worsens with the severity of hyponatremia.[8] Similarly, cirrhotic patients with persistent ascites and a low serum sodium level awaiting transplant have a high mortality risk despite low severity (MELD) scores (see the MELD Score calculator). The independent predictors - ascites and hyponatremia - are findings indicative of hemodynamic decompensation.[9, 10] \n",
      "Hyponatremia affects all races.\n",
      "No sexual predilection exists for hyponatremia. However, symptoms are more likely to occur in young women than in men.\n",
      "Hyponatremia is more common in elderly persons, because they have an increased incidence of comorbid conditions (eg, cardiac, hepatic, or renal failure) that can be complicated by it.\n",
      "Patients may present to medical attention with symptoms related to low serum sodium concentrations. However, many patients present due to manifestations of other medical comorbidities, with hyponatremia being recognized only secondarily. For many people, therefore, the recognition is entirely incidental. Patients may develop clinical symptoms due to the cause of hyponatremia or the hyponatremia itself.\n",
      "Many medical illnesses, such as congestive heart failure, liver failure, renal failure, or pneumonia, may be associated with hyponatremia. These patients frequently present because of primary disease symptomatology (eg, dyspnea, jaundice, uremia, and cough).[11] \n",
      "Symptoms range from nausea and malaise, with mild reduction in the serum sodium, to lethargy, decreased level of consciousness, headache, and (if severe) seizures and coma. Overt neurologic symptoms most often are due to very low serum sodium levels (usually <115 mEq/L), resulting in intracerebral osmotic fluid shifts and brain edema. This neurologic symptom complex can lead to tentorial herniation with subsequent brain stem compression and respiratory arrest, resulting in death in the most severe cases.\n",
      "The severity of neurologic symptoms correlates well with the rate and degree of the drop in serum sodium. A gradual drop in serum sodium, even to very low levels, may be tolerated well if it occurs over several days or weeks, because of neuronal adaptation. The presence of an underlying neurologic disease, like a seizure disorder, or nonneurologic metabolic abnormalities, like hypoxia, hypercapnia, or acidosis, also affects the severity of neurologic symptoms.\n",
      "In interviewing the patient, obtaining a detailed medication history, including information on over-the-counter (OTC) drugs the patient has been using, is important because many medications may precipitate hyponatremia (eg, antipsychotic medications, diuretics). A dietary history with reference to salt, protein, and water intake is useful as well. For patients who are hospitalized, reviewing the records of parenteral fluids administered is crucial.\n",
      "Examination should include orthostatic vital signs and an accurate assessment of volume status. This determination (ie, hypervolemic, euvolemic, hypovolemic) often guides treatment decisions.\n",
      "A full assessment for medical comorbidities is also essential, with particular attention paid to cardiopulmonary and neurologic components of the examination.\n",
      "Although the differential diagnosis is quite broad, hyponatremia can be divided into the following clinically useful groupings:\n",
      "Patients with hypertonic hyponatremia have normal total body sodium and a dilutional drop in the measured serum sodium due to the presence of osmotically active molecules in the serum, which causes a water shift from the intracellular compartment to the extracellular compartment.\n",
      "Glucose produces a drop in the serum sodium level of 1.6 mEq/L for each 100 mg/dL of serum glucose greater than 100 mg/dL. This relationship is nonlinear, with greater reduction in plasma sodium concentrations with glucose concentrations over 400 mg/dL, making 2.4 mEq/L for each 100 mg/dL increase in glucose over 100 mg/dL a more accurate correction factor when the glucose is greater than 400 mg/dL.[12] \n",
      "Other examples of osmotically active molecules include mannitol (often used to treat brain edema) or maltose (used with intravenous immunoglobulin administration).\n",
      "Severe hyperlipidemia and paraproteinemia can lead to low measured serum sodium concentrations with normal serum osmolality. Normally, the plasma water comprises 92-94% of plasma volume. The plasma water fraction falls with an increase in fats and proteins. The measured sodium concentration in the total plasma volume is respectively reduced, although the plasma water sodium concentration and plasma osmolality are unchanged. This artifactual low sodium (so-called pseudohyponatremia) is secondary to measurement by flame photometry. It can be avoided by direct ion-selective electrode measurement.\n",
      "Hyponatremia post-transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) or hysteroscopy is caused by absorption of irrigants, glycine, sorbitol, or mannitol, contained in nonconductive flushing solutions used. The degree of hyponatremia is related to the quantity and rate of fluid absorbed. The plasma osmolality is also variable and changes over time.\n",
      "The presence of a relatively large osmolal gap due to excess organic solute is diagnostic in the appropriate clinical setting. Symptomatic patients are treated depending on plasma osmolality and volume status with hypertonic saline in hypoosmolar state or loop diuretic in volume-overloaded patients with normal renal function.\n",
      "Hemodialysis, which will correct the hyponatremia and remove glycine and its toxic metabolites, can be used in patients with end-stage renal disease. Use of isotonic saline as an irrigant instead of glycine with the new bipolar resectoscope for TURP in high-risk patients (with large prostates that require lengthy resection) could avoid this complication, making this disorder a diagnosis of the past.[13] \n",
      "Hypotonic hyponatremia always reflects the inability of the kidneys to handle the excretion of free water to match intake. It can be divided pathophysiologically into the following categories, according to the effective intravascular volume: hypovolemic, hypervolemic, and euvolemic. These clinically relevant groupings aid in determination of likely underlying etiology and guide treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hypovolemic hypotonic hyponatremia\n",
      "\n",
      "This usually indicates concomitant solute depletion, with patients presenting with orthostatic symptoms. The pathophysiology underlying hypovolemic hypotonic hyponatremia is complex and involves the interplay of carotid baroreceptors, the sympathetic nervous system, the renin-angiotensin system, antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion (vasopressin), and renal tubular function. In the setting of decreased intravascular volume (eg, severe hemorrhage or severe volume depletion secondary to GI or renal loss, or diuretic use) owing to a decreased stretch on the baroreceptors in the great veins, aortic arch, and carotid bodies, an increased sympathetic tone to maintain systemic blood pressure generally occurs.\n",
      "This increased sympathetic tone, along with decreased renal perfusion secondary to intravascular volume depletion, results in increased renin and angiotensin excretion. This, in turn, results in increased sodium absorption in the proximal tubules of the kidney and consequent decreased delivery of solutes to distal diluting segments, causing an impairment of renal free water excretion. There also is a concomitant increase in serum ADH production that further impairs free water excretion. Because angiotensin is also a very potent stimulant of thirst, free water intake is increased, and, at the same time, water excretion is limited. Together, these changes lead to hyponatremia.\n",
      "Cerebral salt wasting (CSW) is seen with intracranial disorders, such as subarachnoid hemorrhage, carcinomatous or infectious meningitis, and metastatic carcinoma, but especially after neurologic procedures. Disruption of sympathetic neural input into the kidney, which normally promotes salt and water reabsorption in the proximal nephron segment through various indirect and direct mechanisms, might cause renal salt wasting, resulting in reduced plasma volume. Plasma renin and aldosterone levels fail to rise appropriately in patients with CSW despite a reduced plasma volume because of disruption of the sympathetic nervous system. In addition, the release of 1 or more natriuretic factors could also play a role in the renal salt wasting seen in CSW. Volume depletion leads to an elevation of plasma vasopressin levels and impaired free water excretion.\n",
      "Distinguishing between CSW and syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion (SIADH) can be challenging, because there is considerable overlap in the clinical presentation. Vigorous salt replacement is required in patients with CSW, whereas fluid restriction is the treatment of choice in patients with SIADH. Infusion of isotonic saline to correct the volume depletion is usually effective in reversing the hyponatremia in cerebral salt wasting, since euvolemia will suppress the release of ADH. The disorder is usually transient, with resolution occurring within 3-4 weeks of disease onset.[14, 15] \n",
      "Salt-wasting nephropathy causing hypovolemic hyponatremia may rarely develop in a range of renal disorders (eg, interstitial nephropathy, medullary cystic disease, polycystic kidney disease, partial urinary obstruction) with low salt intake.\n",
      "Diuretics may induce hypovolemic hyponatremia. Note that thiazide diuretics, in contrast to loop diuretics, impair the diluting mechanism without limiting the concentrating mechanism, thereby impairing the ability to excrete a free water load. Thus, thiazides are more prone to causing hyponatremia than are loop diuretics. This is particularly so in elderly persons, who already have impaired diluting ability.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hypervolemic hypotonic hyponatremia\n",
      "\n",
      "This is characterized by clinically detectable edema or ascites that signifies an increase in total body water and sodium. Paradoxically, however, a decrease in the effective circulating volume, critical for tissue perfusion, stimulates the same pathophysiologic mechanism of impaired water excretion by the kidney that is observed in hypovolemic hypotonic hyponatremia. Commonly encountered examples include liver cirrhosis, congestive heart failure, nephrotic syndrome, and severe hypoproteinemia (albumin level <1.5-2 g/dL).\n",
      "\n",
      "Normovolemic (euvolemic) hypotonic hyponatremia\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a very common cause of hyponatremia in patients who are hospitalized. It is associated with nonosmotic and nonvolume related vasopressin (ADH) secretion (ie, SIADH) secondary to a variety of clinical conditions, including CNS disturbances, major surgery, trauma, pulmonary tumors, infection, stress, and certain medications.\n",
      "Common medications associated with SIADH are as follows: chlorpropamide (potentiating renal action of ADH), carbamazepine (possesses antidiuretic property), cyclophosphamide (marked water retention secondary to SIADH and potentially fatal hyponatremia may ensue in selected cases; use of isotonic saline rather than free water to maintain a high urine output to prevent hemorrhagic cystitis can minimize the risk), vincristine, vinblastine, amitriptyline, haloperidol, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (particularly in elderly patients), and monoamine oxidase (MAO) antidepressants. In these circumstances, the ability of the kidney to dilute urine in the setting of serum hypotonicity is reduced.\n",
      "Hyponatremia is a relatively common adverse effect of desmopressin, a vasopressin analogue that acts as a pure V2 agonist. Its common use in the treatment of central diabetes insipidus, von Willebrand disease, and nocturia in adults and of enuresis in children requires regular monitoring of serum sodium levels.\n",
      "The diagnostic criteria for SIADH are as follows:\n",
      "Normal hepatic, renal, and cardiac function - clinical euvolemia (absence of intravascular volume depletion)\n",
      "Normal thyroid and adrenal function\n",
      "Hypotonic hyponatremia\n",

      "Urinary sodium concentrations are also typically greater than 20 mEq/L on a normal salt diet as sodium excretion will reflect dietary sodium intake. Serum uric acid levels are generally reduced; this is due to reduced tubular uric acid reabsorption, which parallels the decrease in proximal tubular sodium reabsorption associated with central volume expansion. These findings are also found in a renal salt wasting process. This similarity makes the differentiation between salt wasting and SIADH difficult except that in renal wasting, one would expect to find a hypovolemic state.\n",
      "Reset osmostat is another important cause of normovolemic hypotonic hyponatremia. This may occur in elderly patients and during pregnancy. These patients regulate their serum osmolality around a reduced set point; however, in contrast to patients with SIADH (who also have a downward resetting of the osmotic threshold for thirst),[16] they are able to dilute their urine in response to a water load to keep the serum osmolality around the preset low point.\n",
      "Severe hypothyroidism (unknown mechanism, possibly secondary to low cardiac output and glomerular filtration rate) and adrenal insufficiency are also associated with nonosmotic vasopressin release and impaired sodium reabsorption, leading to hypotonic hyponatremia. Hyponatremia associated with cortisol deficiency, such as primary or secondary hypoadrenalism, commonly presents subtly and may go undiagnosed. A random cortisol level check, especially in acute illness, can be misleading if the level is normal (when it should be high). Testing for adrenal insufficiency and hypothyroidism should be part of the hyponatremic workup, as the disorders respond promptly to hormone replacement. Depending on the etiology, mineralocorticoid will also need replacement.\n",
      "Hospitalized patients who are infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) have a high incidence of hyponatremia. In these individuals, hyponatremia is usually due to at least one of the following three disorders associated with an increased ADH level:\n",
      "Increased release of ADH due to malignancy, to occult or symptomatic infection of the central nervous system, or to pneumonia resulting from infection with Pneumocystis carinii or other organisms.\n",
      "Effective volume depletion secondary to fluid loss from the gastrointestinal tract, due primarily to infectious diarrhea.\n",
      "Adrenal insufficiency often due to an adrenalitis, an abnormality that may be infectious in origin, perhaps being induced by cytomegalovirus, Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare, or HIV itself. Affected patients have a high risk of morbidity and mortality.\n",
      "There are other causes that do not fit neatly in any of the above categories and may or may not be associated with elevated levels of ADH or simply overwhelm the capacity of the kidneys to properly excrete excess water.\n",
      "The most common precipitant of hyponatremia in patients after surgery[17] is the iatrogenic infusion of hypotonic fluids. Inappropriate administration of hypotonic intravenous fluids after surgery increases the risk of developing hyponatremia in these vulnerable patients, who retain water due to nonosmotic release of ADH, which is typically elevated for a few days after most surgical procedures. Hospital-acquired acute hyponatremia is disturbingly common also among hospitalized children and adults.\n",
      "Severe malnutrition seen in weight-conscious women (low protein, high water intake diet) is a special condition in which a markedly decreased intake of solutes occurs, which limits the ability of the kidney to handle the free water. Because a mandatory solute loss of 50-100 mOsm/kg of urine exists, free water intake in excess of solute needs can produce hyponatremia.[18] Another example is beer drinker's potomania, because a diet consisting primarily of beer is rich in free water but solute poor.\n",
      "Compulsive intake of large amounts of free water exceeding the diluting capacity of the kidneys (>20 L/d), even with a normal solute intake of 600-900 mOsm/d, may also result in hyponatremia, but in contrast to SIADH, the urine is maximally dilute. In addition to a central defect in thirst regulation, which plays an important role in the pathogenesis of primary polydipsia, different abnormalities in ADH regulation have been identified in psychotic patients, all impairing free water excretion. Transient stimulation of ADH release during acute psychotic episodes, an increase in the net renal response to ADH, downward resetting of the osmostat, and antipsychotic medication may contribute. Limiting water intake will rapidly raise the plasma sodium concentration as the excess water is readily excreted in dilute urine[19] \n",
      "Acute hyponatremia is associated with ultra-endurance athletes and marathon runners. With women making up a higher percentage, the strongest single predictor is weight gain during the race correlating with excessive fluid intake. Longer racing time and body mass index extremes are also associated with hyponatremia, whereas the composition of fluids consumed (plain water rather than sports drinks containing electrolytes) is not. Oxidization of glycogen and triglyceride during a race is associated with the production of \"bound\" water, which then becomes an endogenous, electrolyte-free water infusion contributing to hyponatremia induced by water ingestion in excess of water losses.\n",
      "It should be noted, some collapsed runners are normonatremic or even hypernatremic,[20] making blanket recommendations difficult. However, fluid intake to the point of weight gain should be avoided.[20, 21] Athletes should rely on thirst as their guide for fluid replacement and avoid fixed, global recommendations for water intake. Symptomatic hyponatremic patients should receive 100 mL of 3% sodium chloride over 10 minutes in the field before transportation to hospital. This maneuver should raise the plasma sodium concentration an average of 2-3 mEq/L.[22] \n",
      "Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use may increase the risk of development of hyponatremia by strenuous exercise by inhibiting prostaglandin formation. Prostaglandins have a natriuretic effect. Prostaglandin depletion increases NaCl reabsorption in the thick ascending limb of Henle (ultimately increasing medullary tonicity) and ADH action in the collecting duct, leading to impaired free water excretion.[23] \n",
      "Symptomatic and potentially fatal hyponatremia can develop with rapid onset after ingestion of the designer drug ecstasy (methylenedioxymethamphetamine, or MDMA), an amphetamine. A marked increase in water intake via direct thirst stimulation, as well as inappropriate secretion of ADH, contributes to the hyponatremia seen with even small amount of drug intake.\n",
      "Nephrogenic syndrome of inappropriate antidiuresis (or NSIAD) is an SIADH-like clinical and laboratory picture seen in male infants who present with neurologic symptoms secondary to hyponatremia but who have undetectable plasma arginine vasopressin (AVP) levels. This hereditary disorder is secondary to mutations in the V2 vasopressin receptor, resulting in constitutive activation of the receptor with elevated cAMP production in the collecting duct principle cells. Treatment of NSIAD poses a challenge. Water restriction improves serum sodium levels and osmolality in infants, but it limits calorie intake in these formula-fed infants. The use of demeclocycline or lithium is potentially limited because of adverse effects. The current therapy of choice is fluid restriction and the use of oral urea to induce an osmotic diuresis.[24] \n",
      "Hyponatremic hypertensive syndrome, a rare condition, consists of severe hypertension associated with renal artery stenosis, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, severe thirst, and renal dysfunction characterized by natriuresis, hypercalciuria, renal glycosuria, and proteinuria. Angiotensin-mediated thirst coupled with nonosmotic release of vasopressin provoked by angiotensin II and/or hypertensive encephalopathy are likely mechanisms for this syndrome. Sodium depletion due to pressure natriuresis and potassium depletion due to hyperaldosteronism with high plasma renin activity are also likely to play a role in the pathogenesis of hyponatremia. The abnormalities resolve with correction of the renal artery stenosis.[25] \n",
      "Using a retrospective case note analysis, an Irish study examined the incidence of hyponatremia in a variety of neurologic conditions.[26] The investigators found that the occurrence of hyponatremia was greater in persons with subarachnoid hemorrhage (62 out of 316 patients, or 19.6%; P <0.001), intracranial neoplasm (56 out of 355 patients, or 15.8%; P <0.001), traumatic brain injury (44 out of 457 patients, or 9.6%; P <0.001), and pituitary disorders (5 out of 81 patients, or 6.25%; P = 0.004) than it was in patients with spinal disorders (4 out of 489 patients, or 0.81%).\n",
      "The investigators also determined that the median hospital stay for patients with hyponatremia was 19 days, compared with a median stay of 12 days for the study's other patients.\n",
      "Other problems to consider in the differential diagnosis are as follows:\n",
      "Hyperlipidemia\n",
      "Paraproteinemia\n",
      "Pseudohyponatremia\n",
      "There are three essential laboratory tests in the evaluation of patients with hyponatremia that, together with the history and the physical examination, help to establish the primary underlying etiologic mechanism. (In general, the etiology of the hyponatremia directs its management.) These tests are as follows\n",
      "Urine osmolality\n",
      "Serum osmolality\n",
      "Urinary sodium concentration\n",
      "Urine osmolality helps to differentiate between conditions associated with impaired free water excretion and primary polydipsia, in which water excretion should be normal (provided intact kidney function). With primary polydipsia, as with malnutrition (severe decreased solids intake) and a reset osmostat, the urine osmolality is maximally dilute, generally less than 100 mOsm/kg. A urine osmolality greater than 100 mOsm/kg indicates impaired ability of the kidneys to dilute the urine. This usually is secondary to elevated vasopressin (antidiuretic hormone; ADH) levels, appropriate or inappropriate.\n",
      "Serum osmolality readily differentiates between true hyponatremia and pseudohyponatremia secondary to hyperlipidemia, hyperproteinemia, or hypertonic hyponatremia. Sources of hypertonic hyponatremia include elevations of the following:\n",
      "Glucose\n",
      "Mannitol\n",
      "Glycine (after urologic or gynecologic procedures)\n",
      "Sucrose\n",
      "Maltose (contained in IgG formulations)\n",
      "Urinary sodium concentration helps to differentiate between hyponatremia secondary to hypovolemia and the syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion (SIADH). With SIADH (and salt-wasting syndrome), the urine sodium is greater than 20-40 mEq/L. With hypovolemia, the urine sodium typically measures less than 25 mEq/L. However, if sodium intake in a patient with SIADH (or salt-wasting) happens to be low, then urine sodium may fall below 25 mEq/L.\n",
      "Serum uric acid levels can be important supportive information (they are typically reduced in SIADH and also reduced in salt wasting). After correction of hyponatremia, the hypouricemia corrects in SIADH but remains with a salt-wasting process.\n",
      "Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and serum cortisol levels should be measured if hypothyroidism or hypoadrenalism is suspected.\n",
      "Serum albumin, triglycerides, and a serum protein electrophoresis also may be indicated for particular patients.\n",
      "Head computed tomography (CT) scanning and chest radiography can be used to assess for an underlying etiology in select patients with suspected SIADH or cerebral salt wasting.\n",
      "The recommendations for treatment of hyponatremia rely on the current understanding of the central nervous system (CNS) adaptation to an alteration in serum osmolality. In the setting of an acute fall in the serum osmolality, neuronal cell swelling occurs due to the water shift from the extracellular space to the intracellular space (ie, Starling forces). Therefore, correction of hyponatremia should take into account the limited capacity of this adaptation mechanism to respond to acute alteration in the serum tonicity, because the degree of brain edema and consequent neurologic symptoms depend as much on the rate and duration of hypotonicity as they do on its magnitude.\n",
      "A panel of United States experts on hyponatremia issued guidelines on the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of hyponatremia in 2007; the guidelines were updated in 2013.[27] For treatment of symptomatic patients with acute hyponatremia (ie, with a known duration of <24-48 hours), the panel recommended urgent correction by 4-6 mmol/L to prevent brain herniation and neurological damage from cerebral ischemia. Recommended treatment of acute hyponatremia varies by symptom severity, as follows:\n",
      "To avoid osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) in patients with chronic hyponatremia (known duration >48 hours), the recommendations include the following[27] :\n",
      "For patients with inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), fluid restriction (with a goal of 500 mL/d below the 24-hour urine volume) is generally first-line therapy, but pharmacologic treatment should be strongly considered if the patient's urinary parameters indicate low renal electrolyte-free water excretion or if the serum sodium concentration does not correct after 24-48 hours of fluid restriction. Pharmacologic options include demeclocycline (off label use), urea, and vasopressin receptor antagonists (vaptans). Vaptans should not be used in hypovolemic hyponatremia, or in conjunction with other treatments for hyponatremia.[27] \n",
      "The European Society of Intensive Care Medicine, the European Society of Endocrinology, and the European Renal Association–European Dialysis and Transplant Association have released guidelines on the diagnosis, classification, and treatment of true hypotonic hyponatremia. Treatment recommendations include the following[1, 2] :\n",
      "Consultation with either a nephrologist or a critical care specialist is often of considerable value in managing patients with symptomatic or refractory hyponatremia.\n",
      "When faced with a patient with hyponatremia, the first decision is what type of fluid, if any, should be given. The treatment of hypertonic and pseudohyponatremia is directed at the underlying disorder in the absence of symptoms.\n",
      "Hypotonic hyponatremia accounts for most clinical cases of hyponatremia. The first step in the approach and evaluation of hypotonic hyponatremia is to determine whether emergency therapy is warranted. The following three factors guide treatment:\n",
      "Patient's volume status\n",
      "Duration and magnitude of the hyponatremia\n",
      "Degree and severity of clinical symptoms\n",
      "For the asymptomatic patient, the following treatments may be of use:\n",
      "Hypovolemic hyponatremia: Administer isotonic saline to patients who are hypovolemic to replace the contracted intravascular volume (thereby treating the cause of vasopressin release). Patients with hypovolemia secondary to diuretics may also need potassium repletion, which, like sodium, is osmotically active. Correction of volume repletion turns off the stimulus to ADH secretion, so a large water diuresis may ensue, leading to a more rapid correction of hyponatremia than desired. If so, hypotonic fluid such as D5/½ normal saline may need to be administered (see below under normovolemic hyponatremia for guidelines).\n",
      "Hypervolemic hyponatremia: Treat patients who are hypervolemic with salt and fluid restriction, plus loop diuretics, and correction of the underlying condition. The use of a V2 receptor antagonist may be considered (see below).\n",
      "For normovolemic (euvolemic), asymptomatic hyponatremic patients, free water restriction (<1 L/d) is generally the treatment of choice. There is no role for hypertonic saline in these patients. Base the volume of restriction on the patient's renal diluting capacity. For instance, fluid restriction to 1 L/d, which is enough to raise the serum sodium in some patients, may exceed the renal free water excretion capacity in others, necessitating more severe restriction. This approach is recommended as initial treatment for patients with asymptomatic SIADH. However, many patients will not adhere to fluid restriction. Further, the definition of asymptomatic is changing due to the recognition that subtle but significant deficits, such as in gait, may be present. Therefore, pharmacologic treatment may be considered (see below).\n",
      "When treating patients with overtly symptomatic hyponatremia (eg, seizures, severe neurological deficits), hypertonic (3%) saline should be used. There is no place in the initial treatment for aquaretics (see below). Note that normal saline can exacerbate hyponatremia in patients with SIADH, who may excrete the sodium and retain the water. A liter of normal saline contains 154 mEq sodium chloride (NaCl) and 3% saline has 513 mEq NaCl. Management decisions should also factor in ongoing renal free water and solute losses. Alternately, the combination of intravenous normal saline and diuresis with a loop diuretic (eg, furosemide) also elevates the serum sodium concentration. This latter approach is often useful for patients with high urine osmolality, because the loop diuretic acts to reduce urine osmolality. Concomitant use of loop diuretics increases free water excretion and decreases the risk of fluid overload.\n",
      "The following equation helps to estimate an expected change in serum sodium (Na) with respect to characteristics of infusates used[28] : Change in serum Na = [(infusate Na + infusate K) - serum Na] / [Total body water +1]\n",
      "During therapy, close monitoring of serum electrolytes (ie, every 2-4 h) to avoid overcorrection is essential.\n",
      "Acute hyponatremia (duration < 48 h) can be safely corrected more quickly than chronic hyponatremia. A severely symptomatic patient with acute hyponatremia is in danger from brain edema. In contrast, a symptomatic patient with chronic hyponatremia is more at risk from rapid correction of hyponatremia. Overly rapid correction of serum sodium can precipitate severe neurologic complications, such as central pontine myelinosis, which can produce spastic quadriparesis, swallowing dysfunction, pseudobulbar palsy, and mutism. A symptomatic patient with unknown duration of hyponatremia is the most challenging, warranting a prompt but controlled and limited correction of hyponatremia, until symptoms resolve. However,  fear of osmotic demyelination should not deter prompt and definitive treatment.\n",
      "With patients who are acutely symptomatic (duration <48 h, such as after surgery), the treatment goal is to increase the serum sodium level by approximately 1-2 mEq/L/h for 3-4 hours, until the neurologic symptoms subside or until plasma sodium concentration is over 120 mEq/L.[29] Other authors recommend an even more rapid correction.[6] \n",
      "In chronic, severe symptomatic hyponatremia, the rate of correction should not exceed 0.5-1 mEq/L/h, with a total increase not to exceed 8-12 mEq/L/d and no more than 18 mEq/L in the first 48 h. The sodium concentration must be corrected to a safe range (usually to no greater than 120 mEq/L) rather than to a normal value. As noted above, spontaneous diuresis secondary to ADH suppression with intravascular volume repletion could lead to unintended overcorrection.\n",
      "Pharmacologic agents can be used in some cases of more refractory SIADH, allowing more liberal fluid intake. Demeclocycline has been the drug of choice to increase the diluting capacity of the kidneys, by achieving vasopressin antagonism and a functional diabetes insipidus. This treatment requires 3-4 days for maximal effect. Demeclocycline is contraindicated in cirrhotic patients. Other agents, such as lithium, have been used with variable success. Lithium is also associated with several untoward effects, including thyroid dysfunction, interstitial kidney disease, and, in overdosage, CNS dysfunction, which make its use problematic. The treatment of psychogenic polydipsia can be difficult and may require psychiatric, pharmacologic, and fluid intervention.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aquaretics\n",
      "\n",
      "A new class of drugs, AVP receptor antagonists, designed specifically to promote aquaresis (ie, electrolyte-sparing excretion of free water), has been evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of hyponatremia.[30, 31] The first agent to be approved was conivaptan, a V1A and V2 vasopressin receptor antagonist. It is available only for intravenous use and is approved for use in the hospital setting for euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia. It is contraindicated in hypovolemic patients. It induces both a water and sodium diuresis with improvement in plasma sodium levels. Most of the clinical experience has been in heart failure. It is effective in raising serum sodium levels; however, conivaptan has not been shown to improve heart failure per se. Close monitoring of the rate of correction is needed and is approved for treatment for only 4 days.\n",
      "In addition, the effects in patients with renal and hepatic impairment have not been well studied and caution is advised with use in this population. There are several drug interactions that need close monitoring and the use of conivaptan with CYP3A4 inhibitors is contraindicated.\n",
      "Tolvaptan, a selective V2 receptor antagonist, can be taken orally and has been approved for use in the treatment of euvolemic and hypervolemic hyponatremia, including cases associated with cirrhosis and heart failure. Tolvaptan treatment must be initiated in the hospital to avoid the possibility of too rapid correction (although there have not been reported cases). It shows great promise but because of the requirement for hospitalization for initiation or reintroduction and the expense of the drug, its use at this time is limited. It also interacts with CYP3A inhibitors and use with such drugs is contraindicated. In April 2013, the FDA limited use of tolvaptan to no more than 30 days and indicated that it should not be used in patients with underlying liver disease. This decision was based on reports of liver injury, including those potentially leading to liver transplant or death.[32] \n",
      "The use of these vaptans is limited and exact benefits have yet to be determined. There are reports that even mild hyponatremia can cause gait instability and possibly increase the risk of falls and hip fractures. In this setting, vaptans may be beneficial to improve hyponatremia and gait.\n",
      "Free water restriction often is appropriate for patients with normovolemic hypotonic hyponatremia.\n",
      "Individuals who are undernourished need to maintain an appropriate solute intake. In fact, in patients with SIADH, a high protein intake increases the solute load for excretion, thereby removing more free water. Although unpalatable, oral urea has been used to achieve the same effect.\n",
      "Patients with hyperglycemia or hyperlipidemia should receive appropriate nutritional counseling.\n",
      "The primary treatments used in the management of hyponatremic patients rely on the use of intravenous sodium-containing fluids (normal saline or hypertonic saline) and fluid restriction. Less commonly, loop diuretics (eg, furosemide) or demeclocycline are used. A new class of drugs, AVP receptor antagonists (eg, conivaptan), is now available.[30, 31] \n",
      "Loop diuretics occasionally are used in patients with hyponatremia to increase renal free water excretion.\n",
      "High-ceiling diuretic with a prompt onset of action that acts upon ascending limb of loop of Henle to inhibit sodium/potassium/chloride cotransport system, thereby increasing solute delivery to distal renal tubules, which acts to increase free water excretion. This can lead to increased aldosterone production, resulting in increased sodium absorption. Absorbed readily from the GI tract and also available in parenteral preparations. Diuresis begins 30-60 min with oral vs 5 min with IV administration. Potassium excretion also is increased. Elderly patients may have greater sensitivity to effects of furosemide. \n",
      "Certain antibiotics may affect renal ADH action.\n",
      "Can cause insensitivity of distal renal tubules to the action of ADH and produce a nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Effects are seen within 5 days and are reversed within 2-6 days following cessation of therapy. \n",
      "Treats hyponatremia through V2 antagonism of AVP in the renal collecting ducts. This effect results in aquaresis (excretion of free water).[30, 31] \n",
      "Arginine vasopressin antagonist (V1A, V2) indicated for euvolemic (dilutional) and hypervolemic hyponatremia. Increases urine output of mostly free water, with little electrolyte loss. Over 80% of conivaptan excreted in feces and the rest in urine. \n",
      "Selective vasopressin V2-receptor antagonist. Indicated for hypervolemic and euvolemic hyponatremia (ie, serum sodium level < 125 mEq/L) or less-marked hyponatremia that is symptomatic and has resisted correction with fluid restriction. Used for hyponatremia associated with congestive heart failure, liver cirrhosis, and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion. Initiate or reinitiate in hospital environment only. Duration of use is limited to 30 days to minimize risk of liver injury. \n",
      "Patients with hyponatremia from any cause require close attention to their electrolyte and fluid status.\n",
      "Patients with symptomatic hyponatremia who are being actively treated often require several daily measurements of serum sodium to avoid a rate of correction that is too rapid.\n",
      "After acute treatment, follow-up generally is dictated by the underlying etiology of the hyponatremia.\n",
      "Clinical manifestations include clouding of consciousness, confusion, stupor, or coma. Seizures commonly occur with rapid reductions in serum sodium or with serum sodium concentrations of less than 115-120 mEq/L.\n",
      "For unknown reasons, premenopausal women seem to have a less efficient osmotic adaptation. This increases their susceptibility to severe hyponatremia and rapid progression from minimal symptoms (eg, headache, nausea) to respiratory arrest. Cerebral edema and herniation have been found at autopsy.[33] \n",
      "Correction of hyponatremia that is too rapid may cause permanent neurologic impairment. Central pontine myelinolysis (CPM) and extrapontine myelinolysis (EPM), complications of excessive correction of chronic hyponatremia, are now diagnosed by diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Of note is that conventional CT and MRI scan findings typically lag behind the clinical manifestations of myelinosis by 2-4 weeks.[34] \n",
      "The clinical course of these patients features initial encephalopathy secondary to hyponatremia, then improvement as the plasma Na concentration increases, and finally deterioration several days later. The disorder can resolve completely or result in permanent disability or death. This typical clinical course has been called the osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS). The clinical neurologic picture may be confusing, as it may include a variety of findings from psychiatric, behavioral, and movement disorders, such as dysphagia and flaccid or spastic quadriparesis, depending on the involvement of extrapontine or central pontine myelinolysis. Disruption of the blood-brain barrier is presumed to play an important role in the pathogenesis of osmotic demyelination.\n",
      "An increased susceptibility to osmotic demyelination is also observed in cirrhotic patients. In this setting, myoinositol, the most abundant organic osmolyte, is depleted because of glutamine- and hyponatremia-induced brain cell swelling. CPM is a common and often fatal complication of orthotopic liver transplantation, affecting up to 10% of patients who were hyponatremic prior to transplant.[35] \n",
      "The prognosis for patients with hyponatremia is predicated upon the underlying etiology. A study by Doshi et al found that hyponatremia among patients with cancer is associated with extended hospital stays and higher mortality rates; however, whether long-term correction of hyponatremia would improve these outcomes is unclear.[36] \n",
      "A meta-analysis of 15 studies encompassing 13,816 patients found that any improvement in hyponatremia was associated with a reduced risk of overall mortality (odds ratio [OR]=0.57). With the eight studies that reported a threshold for serum sodium improvement to >130 mmol/L, the association was even stronger (OR=0.51). The reduction in mortality risk persisted at 12-month follow-up (OR=0.55). Reduced mortality was more evident in older patients and in patients with lower serum sodium levels at enrollment.[37] \n",

      "Hysterectomy is the most common non–pregnancy-related major surgery performed on women in the United States. This surgical procedure involves removal of the uterus and cervix, and for some conditions, the fallopian tubes and ovaries.\n",
      "Reasons for choosing this operation are treatment of uterine cancer and various common noncancerous uterine conditions such as fibroids, endometriosis, prolapse that leads to disabling levels of pain, discomfort, uterine bleeding, and emotional stress.\n",
      "Although this procedure is highly successful in curing the disease of concern, it is a surgical alternative with the accompanying risks, morbidity, and mortality that an operative procedure carries and it leads to sterility in women who are premenopausal. The patient may be hospitalized for several days and may require 6-12 weeks of convalescence. Complications, such as excessive bleeding, infection, and injury to adjacent organs, also may occur.\n",
      "For related information, see Medscape's Women's Sexual Health Resource Center. \n",
      "In November 1843, Charles Clay performed the first hysterectomy in Manchester, England. In 1929, Richardson, MD, performed the first total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH), in which the entire uterus and cervix were removed.[1] \n",
      "Fibroids, or leiomyomas, account for one third of hysterectomies and one fifth of gynecological visits, and they create an annual cost of $1.2 billion.[2, 3] They are benign uterine tumors that increase in size and frequency as women age but revert in size postmenopausally.[4, 5] Factors that have proven to contribute to fibroid growth include estrogen, progesterone, insulinlike growth factors I and II, epidermal growth factor, and transforming growth factor-beta.[6] \n",
      "The frequency of fibroid appearance in African American women is 2-3 times higher than in white women. Women who are obese or experience menarche when younger than 12 years are at increased risk of fibroid development due to prolonged exposure to estrogen. Women who have had children are at a lesser risk for fibroid development than women who have never been pregnant.[7] \n",
      "Each fibroid arises from a single monoclonal cell line from the smooth-muscle cells of the myometrium.[8] Most (60%) fibroids are chromosomally normal. The rest have nonrandom chromosomal abnormalities that can be separated into 6 cytogenic subgroups, which are trisomy 12, translocation between chromosome 12 and 14, rearrangements of the short arm of chromosome 6 and the long arm of chromosome 10, and deletions of chromosomes 3 and 7.[9] \n",
      "Asymptomatic fibroids are relatively slow growing and characterize most of the tumors found in patients. Previously, uterine size (consisting of asymptomatic fibroids) equivalent to 12 weeks' gestation (280 g) had been the standard threshold for recommending a hysterectomy. Thus, asymptomatic fibroids of smaller size were handled via observation, with an annual pelvic examination and/or transvaginal ultrasonography. \n",
      "Currently, surgical procedures are not recommended for fibroids based on uterine size alone in the absence of symptoms. According to Reiter et al, no increased incidence in perioperative morbidity existed posthysterectomy in those women with a fibroid uterus larger than 12 weeks' gestational size compared to those women with a fibroid uterus smaller than 12 weeks' gestational size.[10] They concluded that hysterectomy for a large asymptomatic fibroid uterus may not be needed as a means of preventing increased operative morbidity associated with future growth, unless a sarcomatous change is observed. \n",
      "In patients who experience symptoms with fibroids, the symptoms are related to the size, location, and number of fibroids within the uterus. As many as one third of patients with symptomatic uterine fibroids experience abnormal bleeding, cramping, and prolonged and heavy menstrual periods, which can result in anemia. The growth of fibroids to large sizes may cause pressure on local organs; thus, presenting symptoms may include pelvic pain or pressure, pain during sexual intercourse, reduced urinary capacity due to increased bladder pressure, constipation due to increased colon pressure, and infertility or late miscarriages.[6] \n",
      "Endometriosis is responsible for approximately one fifth of hysterectomies, and it affects women during their reproductive years.[11] It is a disease in which tissue similar to the endometrium is present outside the endometrial cavity (in other areas of the body). Such sites include all the reproductive organs, bladder, intestines, bowel, colon, and rectum. Other sites may include uterosacral ligaments, the cul-de-sac, pelvic sidewalls, and surgical scars. This ectopic endometrial tissue responds to monthly hormonal stimulation and, thus, breaks down and bleeds into the peritoneal cavity when located there, causing internal bleeding, inflammation of the surrounding areas, and formation of scar tissue. Scar tissue then can become bands of adhesions that are capable of distorting internal anatomy. Patients also may experience symptoms of pelvic pain; pain during bowel movements, urination, and sexual intercourse; and infertility or miscarriages.[12] \n",
      "Currently, no cure exists for endometriosis. Although many women seek hysterectomy for pain relief, it does not provide a definite cure because some women in whom one or both ovaries are preserved may continue to experience problems with endometriosis that was left behind. \n",
      "Genital prolapse is the indication for approximately 15% of hysterectomies. Various stresses on the pelvic muscles and ligaments can cause significant weakening and, thus, uterine prolapse. The prime cause of insult to the pelvic support structures is childbirth. Therefore, multiple pregnancies and vaginal deliveries increase the risk for uterine prolapse. A few less dramatic causes of increased pelvic pressure include straining during bowel movements, chronic coughing, and obesity. Also, significant pelvic structure weakening occurs postmenopause because estrogen, which pelvic tissues need to maintain their tonicity, is not present in significant amounts after menopause. \n",
      "Women with mild pelvic relaxation may be free of symptoms. However, patients with moderate-to-severe relaxation may experience symptoms that include heaviness and pressure in the vaginal area; low back pain, leakage of urine, which can worsen during heavy lifting, coughing, laughing, or sneezing; urinary tract infections; retention of urine; and problems with sexual intercourse.[11] Although several techniques that provide temporary improvement and control of pelvic relaxation exist, in moderate-to-severe situations, hysterectomy may provide a more functional and longer-lasting results. \n",
      "Cancer of the uterus, or endometrial cancer, is the most common gynecological cancer in the United States, with an estimated 36,100 new cases in 2000.[13] It affects women aged 35-90 years, with a mean age of 62 years. Cancer begins in the lining of the endometrium and can spread to other reproductive organs and to the rest of the body. \n",
      "Stage 1 endometrial cancer is confined to the corpus, or body, of the uterus. Symptoms may include bleeding between periods or, as is in most cases, spotting in patients after menopause. Stage 1 endometrial cancer is very slow growing and highly curable. A hysterectomy is the preferred method of treatment. Not only is the uterus removed, but the ovaries and fallopian tubes also are removed because ovaries are a possible site for more cancer, or they may secrete hormones that play a synergistic role in the growth of the cancer. Surgical menopause due to bilateral oophorectomy compared to natural menopause does not increase all-cause, cardiovascular, or cancer mortality.[14] Only in cases of early endometrial cancers in women who are in their second or early part of the third decade of life are attempts made to preserve the ovaries.\n",
      "In stage 2 endometrial cancer, the cancer has spread to the cervix. Approximately 12,800 new cases of cervical cancer diagnoses occur annually in the United States.[15] Symptoms of cervical cancer include bleeding between periods, bleeding postmenopause, or bleeding after sexual intercourse. In some cases, radical hysterectomy (removal of the uterus, cervix, top portion of vagina, ovaries, fallopian tubes, and tissues in the pelvic cavity surrounding cervix) may be the treatment of choice, along with chemotherapy or radiotherapy if needed. \n",
      "In stage 3A endometrial cancer, the cancer has spread to the ovaries and fallopian tubes. This may be treated with a TAH and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (removal of the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries), along with chemotherapy or radiotherapy if needed. In stage 3B, the cancer has spread to the vagina. In this case, a vaginectomy or radical hysterectomy must be performed, along with chemotherapy or radiotherapy if needed. By stage 3C, the cancer has entered the lymph nodes. In this case, lymph node dissection and hysterectomy is the treatment of choice, along with chemotherapy or radiotherapy if needed. \n",
      "Approximately 600,000 hysterectomies are performed annually in the United States, with a cost of approximately $5 billion per year. \n",
      "The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated 3.1 million US women had a hysterectomy from 2000-2004.\n",
      "The hysterectomy rate decreased slightly from 5.4/1000 in 2000 to 5.1/1000 in 2004.\n",
      "From 2000-2004, rates of hysterectomy differed by age. Overall rates were highest among women aged 40-44 years and lowest among women aged 15-24 years. Hysterectomy rates among women aged 50-54 years decreased significantly from 8.9/1000 in 2000 to 6.7/1000 in 2004. \n",
      "Hysterectomy rates also differed by geographic region. The overall rate was highest for women living in the South (6.3/1000) and lowest for those in the Northeast (4.3/1000). Hysterectomy rates in the Northeast decreased from 4.9/1000 in 2000 to 3.7/1000 in 2004. \n",
      "From 2000-2004, the most common medical reasons for undergoing a hysterectomy included benign fibroid tumors, endometriosis, and uterine prolapse. Uterine cancer was not as common but is an important reason for undergoing a hysterectomy. \n",
      "The proportion of hysterectomies with an indication of uterine leiomyoma decreased from 44.2% in 2003 to 38.7% in 2004.\n",
      "The relative proportions of all hysterectomies performed as laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy (LAVH) peaked at 13% in 1995 and then steadily declined to 3.9% in 2003 (p for trend < 0.001), whereas the relative proportion of subtotal abdominal hysterectomy increased from 6.9% in 1994 to 20.8% in 2003 (p for trend < 0.001). \n",
      "Preoperative evaluation includes the following:\n",
      "Complete history and physical: Evaluate, in detail, any comorbid conditions such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cardiac disease, or asthma. \n",
      "Medication history such as use of aspirin, oral hypoglycemics, heparin, or warfarin\n",
      "PAP smear, endometrial sampling, ultrasonography, CBC count, blood type and cross match, and, depending upon age and risk factors, ECG and chest radiograph. \n",
      "In case of malignancy, preoperative staging can be determined with the help of biopsies, CAT scans, IVP, cystoscopy, barium enema, etc. \n",
      "Reasons for choosing hysterectomy are treatment of uterine cancer, ovarian cancer, some cases of cervical cancer, and various common noncancerous uterine conditions like fibroids, endometriosis, uterine prolapse that leads to disabling levels of pain, discomfort, uterine bleeding, and emotional stress.\n",
      "Various hysterectomy procedures are available, including the following: \n",
      "Total abdominal hysterectomy involves removal of the uterus and cervix through an abdominal incision.\n",
      "Supracervical or subtotal hysterectomy is removal of the uterus through an abdominal incision, while sparing the cervix.\n",
      "Radical hysterectomy is extensive surgery that, in addition to removal of the uterus and cervix, might include removal of lymph nodes, loose areolar tissue near major blood vessels, upper vagina, and omentum. \n",
      "Oophorectomy and salpingo-oophorectomy: Oophorectomy is the surgical removal of the ovary and salpingo-oophorectomy is the removal of the ovary and the fallopian tube. \n",
      "Vaginal hysterectomy is removal of the uterus and the cervix through the vagina.\n",
      "Laparoscopy-assisted vaginal hysterectomy is vaginal hysterectomy with the help of laparoscopy.\n",
      "The uterus is the inverted pear-shaped female reproductive organ that lies in the midline of the body, within the pelvis between the bladder and the rectum. It is a dynamic female reproductive organ that is responsible for several reproductive functions, including menses, implantation, gestation, labor, and delivery. It is responsive to the hormonal milieu within the body, which allows adaptation to the different stages of a woman’s reproductive life. The uterus adjusts to reflect changes in ovarian steroid production during the menstrual cycle and displays rapid growth and specialized contractile activity during pregnancy and childbirth. It can also remain in a relatively quiescent state during the prepubertal and postmenopausal years. \n",
      "The ovaries are small, oval-shaped, and grayish in color, with an uneven surface. The actual size of an ovary depends on a woman’s age and hormonal status; the ovaries, covered by a modified peritoneum, are approximately 3-5 cm in length during childbearing years and become much smaller and then atrophic once menopause occurs. A cross-section of the ovary reveals many cystic structures that vary in size. These structures represent ovarian follicles at different stages of development and degeneration. \n",
      "For more information about the relevant anatomy, see Female Reproductive Organ Anatomy, Uterus Anatomy, and Ovary Anatomy.\n",
      "Vaginal hysterectomy is contraindicated in only 10-20% of cases, eg, uterine size greater than 280 g[16] , previous multiple abdominal or pelvic surgeries, advanced uterine or cervical malignancies, and ovarian malignancies. \n",
      "Lab studies related to hysterectomy include CBC count, Papanicolaou test, endometrial sampling, ultrasonography, blood type and cross match, and, in some cases, chest radiography, ECG, CAT scan, MRI, cystoscopy, barium enema, IVP, blood chemistry, tumor markers.\n",
      "Although hysterectomy is often the definitive treatment for many pelvic pathologies, nonsurgical alternatives should always be attempted in elective cases.\n",
      "Hormonal therapy, gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonists, progesterone-containing IUD, endometrial ablation, focused ultrasonographic surgery, cryotherapy, and uterine artery embolization have been used with success.\n",
      "In the 6 states studied, the diffusion of endometrial ablation has had a varying impact on hysterectomy rates among women with benign uterine conditions. However, endometrial ablation is used as an additive medical technology rather than a substitute. \n",
      "Please see the algorithm below.\n",
      "In November 1843, Charles Clay performed the first hysterectomy in Manchester, England. The earliest hysterectomies were supracervical, or subtotal, hysterectomies. The body of the uterus was removed while the cervix remained intact. In 1929, Richardson, MD, performed the first TAH, in which the entire uterus was removed.[1] \n",
      "Prior to an abdominal hysterectomy, the patient undergoes a regional or general anesthetic. A patient remains awake during a regional anesthetic, with only part of the body being numbed to prevent pain. When given a general anesthetic, the patient is unconscious. In the absence of contraindications, neuraxial anesthesia provides a better quality of recovery than general anesthesia.[17] \n",
      "The abdominal hysterectomy begins via a surgical incision 6-8 inches long, made either vertically, running from the navel to the pubic bone, or horizontally, running along the top of the pubic hairline. The cut exposes the ligaments and blood vessels surrounding the uterus. These ligaments and blood vessels then are separated from the uterus and cervix. In the process, the blood vessels are tied off to prevent bleeding and to help in healing. The uterus and cervix are then cut off at the superior portion of the vagina and removed. The top of the vaginal cuff is closed with sutures, and the surgical wound is closed in layers.\n",
      "An abdominal hysterectomy may be performed in conjunction with a salpingo-oophorectomy, in which the adnexa are removed, if needed. Possible complications include surgical wound infection; excessive bleeding; injury to the bowel, bladder, or ureter; nerve damage; and urinary tract infection. Candidates for this surgery include those who have fibroids, abnormal or heavy bleeding, chronic pelvic pain, endometriosis, adenomyosis (endometrial tissue that has infiltrated the myometrium), uterine prolapse, cancer of the reproductive organs, or pelvic inflammatory disease. \n",
      "In a vaginal hysterectomy, the uterus is removed through the vaginal introitus. Prior to surgery, the patient is given a regional or a general anesthetic and the skin surrounding the vagina is prepped with an antibacterial solution. A surgical incision is then made in a circular fashion around the cervix and through the upper vagina to expose the tissue and blood vessels around the cervix and uterus. The tissues and vessels are cut and tied off for the uterus and cervix to be removed from the top of the vagina. The upper part of the vagina, where the surgical incision was made, is then sutured. \n",
      "Possible complications include surgical wound infection; excessive bleeding; injury to the bowel, bladder, or ureter; nerve damage; and urinary tract infection. Often, colporrhaphy (reconstructive surgery) is performed to repair or prevent cystocele, rectocele, and/or vaginal vault prolapse.\n",
      "Candidates for this surgery include those who have fibroids, abnormal or heavy bleeding, adenomyosis, uterine prolapse, early-stage cancer of the reproductive organs, or precancerous conditions of reproductive organs. \n",
      "Laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy (LAVH) is a procedure that uses laparoscopic surgical techniques and instruments to remove the uterus, cervix, and/or fallopian tubes and ovaries through the vagina. Prior to surgery, the patient is usually given a general anesthetic and the abdomen and vagina are prepared with an antibacterial solution. \n",
      "LAVH begins with several small abdominal incisions inferior to the belly button, which allow the insertion of the laparoscope and other surgical tools. In order for the surgeon to observe the inside of the body clearly, the peritoneal cavity is inflated with gas (usually carbon dioxide), and a camera, which is attached to the laparoscope, captures and produces a continuous image that is magnified and projected onto a television screen.\n",
      "Using the laparoscopic surgical tools, the tissues and vessels surrounding the uterus are cut and tied off. The uterus and cervix are then removed through the vagina, and the top of the vaginal cuff is sutured. The fallopian tubes and ovaries also may be removed during this surgical procedure. \n",
      "Possible complications include surgical wound infection; excessive bleeding; injury to the bowel, bladder, or ureter; nerve damage; and urinary tract infection. Candidates for this surgery include those who have had previous abdominal surgery, large fibroids, chronic pelvic pain, endometriosis, or pelvic inflammatory disease, or those who want an oophorectomy. Today, robotic laparoscopic surgery, such as procedures involving the da Vinci Surgical Robot, is also being refined to evaluate the performance of LAVH.\n",
      "Laparoscopic hysterectomy (LH) is a procedure in which the uterus and cervix are dissected and ligated from ligaments, tissues, vagina, and blood vessels and removed entirely from small abdominal incisions with the help of instruments like the morcellator. This procedure requires good surgical technique, intra and extracorporal sutures, and different hemostatic devices.\n",
      "A meta-analysis showed no difference between total LH and vaginal hysterectomy for benign disease in perioperative complications.[18] Total LH was associated with lower pain scores and reduced hospital stay but took longer to perform.\n",
      "Supracervical hysterectomy is defined as removal of the uterine corpus with preservation of the cervix and can be performed through abdominal, laparoscopic, or robotic approaches.\n",
      "During supracervical hysterectomy, removal of the corpus is at or below the internal os along with ablation of the endocervical canal. During laparoscopic and robotically assisted hysterectomy, morcellation of the uterine fundus is performed to facilitate its removal through the port site incisions.\n",
      "Women with known or suspected gynecological cancer, current or recent cervical dysplasia, or endometrial hyperplasia are not candidates for a supracervical procedure.\n",
      "Evidence regarding the potential benefits of this procedure like less blood loss, shorter operating time, and fewer complications are limited to retrospective series. Patients should be counseled about the need for long-term follow up, the possibility of future trachelectomy, and the lack of data demonstrating clear benefits over total hysterectomy; hence, it should not be recommended by the surgeon as a superior technique for hysterectomy for benign diseases.[19] \n",
      "Da Vinci surgical system was approved for use in gynecological surgery by FDA in 2005. Da Vinci hysterectomy involves a robotic system in which the surgeon's hands are naturally positioned while his or her fingers grasp the controls below the display, and movements are transferred in real time to surgical instruments inside the patient. This system is useful when the surgery involves dissection in a difficult situation, such as near the ureters, bladder, or blood vessels.\n",
      "The current system consists of 4 components: (1) console where the surgeon sits and views the screen and controls the robotic instruments, (2) robotic cart with interactive arms, (3) camera and vision system, (4) wristed instruments with computer interfaces.\n",
      "Advantages are 3-dimensional visualization with improved depth of perception, improved dexterity, less blood loss, shorter hospital stay, less pain, and less risk of wound infection.\n",
      "Disadvantages include high cost, increased operating time associated with set up and docking, lack of tactile feedback, inability to reposition the patient once the robotic arms are attached, and the bulkiness of the system.[20] \n",
      "With the various hysterectomy procedures available, physicians must limit healthcare dollars associated with these surgical procedures while maintaining quality health care for patients. Various studies have been performed to decide which surgical procedure is most suitable in terms of economics and patient health. \n",
      "The severity of the pathological disorder must be the key standard in selecting the type of hysterectomy, in order to maintain optimum surgical practice. In studies performed in the United States, France, and the United Kingdom in which strict guidelines based on the severity of the pathological disorder have been implemented, most patients underwent successful vaginal hysterectomy without abdominal or laparoscopic assistance.[21] \n",
      "In a study by Gimbel et al subtotal hysterectomy is faster to perform, has less perioperative bleeding, and seems to have less intra- and postoperative complications.[22] However it does have a slightly high rate of urinary incontinence and cervical stump problems.\n",
      "Significantly improved outcomes suggest vaginal hysterectomy (VH) should be performed in preference to abdominal hysterectomy (AH) where possible. Where VH is not possible, LH may avoid the need for AH; however, the length of the surgery increases as the extent of the surgery performed laparoscopically increases, particularly when the uterine arteries are divided laparoscopically. Also, laparoscopic approaches require greater surgical expertise.[23] \n",
      "Four-year follow-up data indicate that patients who underwent laparoscopic hysterectomy reported a better quality of life compared to those who underwent AH. Laparoscopic hysterectomy should be considered for patients in whom VH is not possible.[24] \n",
      "Early feeding (oral intake of fluids or food within 24 h of surgery, irrespective of bowel sounds) after major abdominal gynecological surgery is safe and associated with reduced length of hospital stay but increased nausea. Further studies should focus on the cost effectiveness, patient satisfaction, and other physiological changes.[25] \n",
      "After the surgery, it takes 4-6 weeks to recover. Recovery is earlier in cases of vaginal hysterectomy and laparoscopically assisted vaginal hysterectomy. \n",
      "No lifting anything heavy for 6 weeks after the surgery.\n",
      "In case of oophorectomy in premenopausal women, patients experience menopausal symptoms like hot flashes, vaginal dryness, and mood disturbances. \n",
      "Return to normal sexual activities is expected after 6 weeks of surgery.\n",
      "For excellent patient education resources, see eMedicineHealth's patient education articles Cervical Cancer, Female Sexual Problems, and Pain During Intercourse.\n",
      "Possible complications of hysterectomy include surgical wound infection; excessive bleeding; injury to the bowel, bladder, ureter, or major blood vessel; urinary tract infection, nerve damage, postoperative thromboembolism, atelectasis, early onset of menopause, and loss of ovarian function. In a 2012 prospective study, hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy, compared with hysterectomy with ovarian conservation or natural menopause, was associated with greater increases in BMI in the years following the procedure.[26] \n",
      "Hur et al found that the 10-year cumulative incidence of dehiscence after any type of hysterectomy was 0.24% and 1.35% after total laparoscopic hysterectomies.[27] \n",
      "A study by Dessources et al found that postoperative complications were the strongest risk factors for 30-day hospital readmission following hysterectomy, including in women with uterine cancer and in those who underwent hysterectomy for benign conditions. Complications related to readmission included wound complications, infections, and pulmonary emboli and myocardial infarctions, with the 30-day readmission rate being 6.1% among women with uterine cancer and 3.4% for those with a benign disease.[28] \n",
      "As more pharmacologic and invasive radiologic interventions become available, the number of hysterectomies performed in the United States and abroad will continue to decrease.\n",
      "Compared with hysterectomy, uterine artery embolization (UAE) was associated with higher rates of minor postprocedural complications such as vaginal discharge, postpuncture hematoma, and postembolization syndrome (pain, fever, nausea, vomiting), as well as higher unscheduled visits and readmission rates after discharge. No evidence shows a benefit of UAE over surgery(hysterectomy/myomectomy) for satisfaction. Currently, the ongoing trials REST (UK) and EMMY have yet to report on the long-term follow-up.[29] \n",
      "Not only will surgical techniques continue to be updated and improved, but preoperative and postoperative interventions will improve morbidity, mortality, and quality of life. \n",
      "Because the uterus is associated with femininity, some women experience a sense of loss after a hysterectomy. However, some women find a hysterectomy enhances their quality of life because it provides relief of symptoms and definite contraception.\n",
      "Hysterectomy, whether total or subtotal, may improve quality of life and psychological outcome.[30] \n",

      "Esophageal cancer is a devastating disease. Although some patients can be cured, the treatment for esophageal cancer is protracted, diminishes quality of life, and is lethal in a significant number of cases. \n",
      "The principal histologic types of esophageal cancer are squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. As squamous cells line the entire esophagus, squamous cell carcinoma can occur in any part of the esophagus; it often arises, however, in the upper half of the esophagus. Adenocarcinoma typically develops in specialized intestinal metaplasia (Barrett metaplasia) that develops as a result of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD); thus, adenocarcinoma typically arises in the lower half of the distal esophagus. (See Pathophysiology and Etiology.) \n",
      "The most common presenting symptom of esophageal cancer is dysphagia (see Presentation). Esophagogastroduodenoscopy allows direct visualization and biopsies of the tumor, while endoscopic ultrasonography is the most sensitive test for determining the depth of penetration of the tumor and the presence of enlarged periesophageal lymph nodes. In patients who appear to have localized esophageal cancer, positron emission tomography (PET) scanning may be useful as part of the baseline staging. Other imaging studies may be valuable in selected patients. (See Workup.) \n",
      "Surgery has traditionally been the treatment for esophageal carcinoma. The first successful resection was performed in 1913 by Torek.[3] In the 1930s, Ohsawa in Japan and Marshall in the United States were the first to perform successful single-stage transthoracic esophagectomies with continent reconstruction.[4, 5] Nonoperative therapy is usually reserved for patients who are not candidates for surgery because of clinical conditions or advanced disease. (See Treatment.) \n",
      "The ideal treatment for localized esophageal cancer is sometimes debated across practice cultures and subspecialties. Defendants of surgical treatment argue that resection is the only treatment modality to offer curative intent; defendants of the nonsurgical approach claim that esophagectomy has a prohibitive index of mortality and that esophageal cancer is an incurable disease. \n",
      "Esophageal lesions other than cancer can cause dysphagia. These include peptic strictures from gastroesophageal reflux and benign esophageal tumors (principally esophageal leiomyoma). Imaging studies help to differentiate these lesions from esophageal cancer. Other differentials include the following \n",

      "The esophagus is a muscular tube that extends from the level of the 7th cervical vertebra to the 11th thoracic vertebra. The esophagus can be divided into the following anatomic parts: \n",
      "Cervical esophagus\n",
      "Thoracic esophagus\n",
      "Abdominal esophagus\n",
      "The blood supply of the cervical esophagus is derived from the inferior thyroid artery, while the blood supply for the thoracic esophagus comes from the bronchial arteries and the aorta. The abdominal esophagus is supplied by branches of the left gastric artery and inferior phrenic artery. \n",
      "Venous drainage of the cervical esophagus is through the inferior thyroid vein, while the thoracic esophagus drains via the azygous vein, the hemiazygous vein, and the bronchial veins. The abdominal esophagus drains through the coronary vein. \n",
      "The esophagus is characterized by a rich network of lymphatic channels in the submucosa that can facilitate the longitudinal spread of neoplastic cells along the esophageal wall. Lymphatic drainage is to cervical nodes, tracheobronchial and mediastinal nodes, and gastric and celiac nodes.\n",
      "The progression of Barrett metaplasia to adenocarcinoma is associated with several changes in gene structure, gene expression, and protein structure.[6, 7, 8] The oncosuppressor gene TP53 and various oncogenes, particularly erb -b2, have been studied as potential markers. \n",
      "Casson and colleagues identified mutations in the TP53 gene in patients with Barrett epithelium associated with adenocarcinoma.[9] In addition, alterations in p16 genes and cell cycle abnormalities or aneuploidy appear to be some of the most important and well-characterized molecular changes. \n",
      "The etiology of esophageal carcinoma is thought to be related to exposure of the esophageal mucosa to noxious or toxic stimuli, resulting in a sequence of dysplasia to carcinoma in situ to carcinoma. In Western cultures, retrospective evidence has implicated cigarette smoking and chronic alcohol exposure as the most common etiologic factors for squamous cell carcinoma. High body mass index, GERD, and resultant Barrett esophagus are often the associated factors for esophageal adenocarcinoma.[10] \n",
      "Nutritional deficiencies have been recognized as contributing factors. In high-risk regions such as parts of China and Iran, deficiencies in vitamins (eg, riboflavin) or micronutrients may play a role in causation. \n",
      "A variety of other factors may promote esophageal cancer. These include the following:\n",
      "Caustic injuries\n",
      "Certain foodstuffs (eg, betel nut)\n",
      "Drinking scalding-hot liquids\n",
      "Environmental contributors (eg, nitrosamines in soil)\n",
      "Certain fungi, molds, or yeasts\n",

      "A genome-wide association study by Wu et al identified seven susceptibility loci on chromosomes 5q11, 6p21, 10q23, 12q24, and 21q22, suggesting the involvement of multiple genetic loci and gene-environment interaction in the development of esophageal cancer.[11] Individuals with the genetic disorder tylosis palmaris et plantaris are at very high risk for esophageal cancer. Plummer-Vinson syndrome also increases its risk. \n",
      "Bisphosphonate use can result in esophagitis and has been suggested as a risk factor for esophageal carcinoma. However, a large study found no significant difference in the frequency of esophageal or gastric cancers between the bisphosphonate cohort and the control group.[12] \n",
      "The Netherlands Cohort Study, a prospective study in 120,852 participants, demonstrated the combined effects of smoking and alcohol consumption on risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus.[13] Among participants who drank 30 g or more of ethanol daily, the multivariable adjusted incidence rate ratio (RR) for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma was 4.61 compared with abstainers. The RR for current smokers who consumed more than 15 g/day of ethanol was 8.05 when compared with nonsmokers who consumed less than 5 g/day of ethanol. \n",
      "No associations were found between alcohol consumption and esophageal adenocarcinoma.\n",
      "In contrast, the risk of squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma of the esophagus was increased among current smokers.[13] \n",
      "A study by Steevens et al found that among current smokers, increased consumption of specific groups of vegetables and fruits were inversely associated with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and esophageal adenocarcinoma risk.[14] Total vegetable consumption nonsignificantly reduced the risk for both esophageal cancer types. Consumption of raw vegetables and of citrus fruits was inversely associated with risk for esophageal adenocarcinoma.\n",
      "Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection has been recognized as a contributing factor to esophageal cancer. However, Sitas et al reported limited serologic evidence of an association between esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and HPV in a study of more than 4000 subjects. The study could not exclude the possibility that certain HPV types may be involved in a small subset of cancers, although HPV does not appear to be an important risk factor.[15] \n",
      "Helicobacter pylori infection, which can cause stomach cancer, has not been associated with esophageal cancer.\n",
      "GERD is the most common predisposing factor for adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. Adenocarcinoma may represent the last event of a sequence that starts with irritation caused by the reflux of acid and bile and progresses to specialized intestinal (Barrett) metaplasia, low-grade dysplasia, high-grade dysplasia, and finally adenocarcinoma. Approximately 10-15% of patients who undergo endoscopy for evaluation of GERD symptoms are found to have Barrett epithelium. (See the chart below.)\n",
      "In 1952, Morson and Belcher published the first description of a patient with adenocarcinoma of the esophagus arising in a columnar epithelium with goblet cells.[16] In 1975, Naef et al emphasized the malignant potential of Barrett esophagus.[17] The risk of adenocarcinoma among patients with Barrett metaplasia has been estimated to be 30-60 times that of the general population.\n",
      "A nationwide population-based case-control study performed in Sweden found an odds ratio of 7.7 for adenocarcinoma among persons with recurrent symptoms of reflux, as compared with persons without such symptoms, and an odds ratio of 43.5 among patients with long-standing and severe symptoms of reflux.[10] \n",
      "Although the annual risk of developing esophageal adenocarcinoma in people with GERD has been reported at 0.5%, some studies have found lower risk. Data from the Northern Ireland Barrett Esophagus Register, which is one of the largest population-based registries in the world, found that the malignant progression among patients with Barrett esophagus was 0.22% per year. This suggests that current surveillance approaches may not be cost effective.[18] \n",
      "A study by Hvid-Jensen et al examined a large Danish registry (11,028 patients over a median of 5.2 y) and found the incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma to be 1.2 cases per 1000 person-years (or 0.12% annual risk). Low-grade dysplasia detected on index endoscopy was associated with an incidence rate of 5.1 cases per 1000 person-years, compared with 1 per 1000 person-years among those without dysplasia.[19] \n",
      "Esophageal cancer is the seventh most common cause of cancer death in males.[20] The 5-year survival rate from 2001 to 2007 was 19%.[21] \n",
      "The American Cancer Society estimates that 17,990 new cases of esophageal cancer (14,440 in men and 3,550 in women) will occur in the United States in 2013; 15,210 persons (12,220 men and 2,990 women) are expected to die of the disease. \n",
      "The incidence rate of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus in the United States showed an average annual increase of 1.7% in men and 1.9% in women from 1999 to 2008.[21] The incidence of esophageal carcinoma is approximately 3-6 cases per 100,000 persons, although certain endemic areas appear to have higher per-capita rates. The age-adjusted incidence is 5.8 cases per 100,000 persons.\n",
      "The epidemiology of esophageal carcinoma has changed markedly over the past several decades in the United States.[22] Until the 1970s, squamous cell carcinoma was the most common type of esophageal cancer (90-95%). It was located in the thoracic esophagus and most frequently affected African-American men with a long history of smoking and alcohol consumption. \n",
      "Over the last 4 decades, the incidence of adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus and gastroesophageal junction has increased progressively. Currently, it accounts for more than 70% of all the new cases of esophageal cancer. \n",
      "Esophageal cancer is the seventh leading cause of cancer death worldwide. In some regions, such as areas of northern Iran, some areas of southern Russia, and northern China, the incidence of esophageal carcinoma may be as high as 800 cases per 100,000 population. Unlike in the United States, squamous cell carcinoma is responsible for 95% of all esophageal cancers worldwide. \n",
      "Esophageal cancer is generally more common in men than in women. The male-to-female ratio is 3-4:1.\n",
      "Esophageal cancer occurs most commonly during the sixth and seventh decades of life. The disease becomes more common with advancing age; it is about 20 times more common in persons older than 65 years than it is in individuals below that age. \n",
      "Survival in patients with esophageal cancer depends on the stage of the disease. Squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma, stage-by-stage, appear to have equivalent survival rates.\n",
      "Lymph node or solid organ metastases are associated with low survival rates. In 2001-2007, the overall 5-year survival rate for esophageal cancer was 19%.[21] Patients without lymph node involvement have a significantly better prognosis and 5-year survival rate than patients with involved lymph nodes. Stage IV lesions are associated with a 5-year survival rate of less than 5%. (See the table below.) \n",
      "A report of 1085 patients who underwent transhiatal esophagectomy for cancer showed that the operation was associated with a 4% operative mortality rate and a 23% 5-year survival rate. A better 5-year survival rate (48%) was identified in a subgroup of patients who had a complete response (ie, disappearance of the tumor) following preoperative radiation and chemotherapy (ie, neoadjuvant therapy).[23] \n",

      "Suzuki et al found that a higher initial standardized uptake value on positron emission tomography (PET) scanning is associated with poorer overall survival among patients with esophageal or gastroesophageal carcinoma receiving chemoradiation. The authors suggested that PET scanning may become useful for individualizing therapy.[26] \n",
      "A study by Gillies et al also found that PET-computed tomography (CT) scanning can be used to predict survival; in this study, the presence of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid lymph nodes was an independent adverse prognostic factor.[27] \n",
      "A study by Prins et al of human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER-2) protein overexpression and HER-2 gene amplification in esophageal carcinomas found that HER-2 positivity and gene amplification are independently associated with poor survival. In their study, which involved 154 patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma, HER-2 positivity was seen in 12% of these patients and overexpression was seen in 14% of them.[28] \n",
      "Dysphagia, the most common presenting symptom of esophageal cancer, is initially experienced for solids but eventually progresses to include liquids. A complaint of dysphagia in an adult should always prompt an endoscopy to help rule out the presence of esophageal cancer. A barium swallow study is also indicated in these cases. \n",
      "Other symptoms include the following:\n",
      "Weight loss - This is the second most common symptom and occurs in more than 50% of people with esophageal carcinoma\n",
      "Bleeding - Patients may experience bleeding from the tumor\n",
      "Pain - Pain may be felt in the epigastric or retrosternal area; pain over bony structures indicates metastatic disease\n",
      "Hoarseness - This is caused by invasion of the recurrent laryngeal nerve; it is a sign that the cancer has progressed beyond the point at which surgical resection remains possible \n",
      "Persistent cough\n",
      "Respiratory symptoms - These can be caused by aspiration of undigested food or by direct invasion of the tracheobronchial tree by the tumor; the latter is also a sign of unresectability \n",
      "Physical examination findings in patients with esophageal cancer are typically normal, unless the cancer has metastasized to neck nodes or the liver. Lymphadenopathy in the laterocervical or supraclavicular area or the presence of hepatomegaly often indicates unresectable disease. \n",
      "The goals of the workup are to establish the diagnosis and to stage the cancer. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy allows direct visualization and biopsies of the tumor. (See the image below.)\n",
      "Laboratory studies in patients with esophageal cancer focus principally on patient factors that may affect treatment. Nutritional status should be evaluated in patients with dysphagia; liver function studies should be performed in alcoholic patients.\n",
      "In 2013, the Society of Thoracic Surgeons released clinical practice guidelines to assist in the diagnosis and treatment of localized esophageal cancer. Their recommendations include the following[29, 30] : \n",
      "For the diagnosis of esophageal cancer, flexible endoscopy with biopsy is the primary method\n",
      "For early-stage esophageal cancer, CT of the chest and abdomen is an optional test for staging; for locoregionalized esophageal cancer, CT of the chest and abdomen is a recommended test for staging \n",
      "For early-stage esophageal cancer, PET is an optional test for staging. For locoregionalized esophageal cancer, PET is a recommended test for staging \n",
      "In patients without metastatic disease, endoscopic ultrasonography is recommended to improve the accuracy of staging\n",
      "In patients with small, discrete nodules or areas of dysplasia in whom disease appears limited to the mucosa or submucosa as assessed by endoscopic ultrasonography, endoscopic mucosal resection should be considered as a diagnostic/staging tool \n",
      "In patients with locally advanced (T3/T4) adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction infiltrating the anatomic cardia or Siewart type III esophagogastric tumors, laparoscopy is recommended to improve accuracy of staging \n",
      "Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is the most sensitive test for determining the depth of tumor penetration (T staging) and the presence of enlarged periesophageal lymph nodes (N staging).[31] \n",
      "Abdominal and chest computed tomography (CT) scans are useful for helping to exclude the presence of metastases (M staging) to the lungs and liver and may be useful for helping to determine whether adjacent structures have been invaded.[32] (See the image below.)\n",
      "Positron emission tomography (PET) scanning is also a useful baseline imaging technique (see the image below) and is increasingly becoming standard in the staging of esophageal cancer. It may be particularly useful in detecting occult distant lymph node metastases and bone spread. In addition, the intensity of radiopharmaceutical uptake on PET scans may reflect the biology of the cancer and thus may have prognostic significance.[26] \n",
      "Bronchoscopy is indicated for cancers of the middle and upper third of the thoracic esophagus to help exclude invasion of the trachea or bronchi. Laparoscopy and thoracoscopy have a greater than 92% accuracy in staging regional nodes. \n",
      "Barium swallow is very sensitive for detecting strictures (see the first image below) and intraluminal masses (see the second image below) but does not allow staging and biopsy. It is now rarely used, but it may be helpful for studying the distal anatomy in obstructive tumors that are inaccessible by endoscopy.\n",

      "Esophageal cancer staging follows the tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) classification of the American Joint Cancer Committee/Union for International Cancer Control/ (AJCC/UICC). The classification and staging scheme was changed in the 7th edition of the AJCC/UICC manual, published in 2010.[33] \n",
      "No completely satisfactory method is available to clinically stage esophageal cancer. The difficulty of clinically assessing the disease is reflected by changes over time in the AJCC staging system. The 1983 system was based on the length of the intraluminal esophageal tumor, the presence of esophageal obstruction, and the involvement of palpable lymph nodes. This clinical staging system proved to be limited.\n",
      "The 1988 revision defined a clinical and pathologic staging system based entirely on the depth of esophageal wall invasion and the presence or absence of local nodal involvement. Neither of these parameters is assessed easily on a clinical basis. Hofstetter et al therefore proposed incorporating the number of involved lymph nodes with regional and nonregional node location.[34] This modification, which seemed to be simpler and to better predict long-term survival, was adopted into the revised system. \n",

      "All esophageal tumors, as well as tumors with epicenters within 5 cm of the esophagogastric junction that also extend into the esophagus, are classified and staged according to the AJCC/UICC esophageal scheme. Tumors with an epicenter in the stomach that are more than 5 cm from the esophagogastric junction or those within 5 cm of the esophagogastric junction without extension into the esophagus are staged using the gastric carcinoma scheme. \n",
      "Other classifications—such as that of the Japanese Society for Esophageal Diseases, which is widely used in Asia—differ from that of the AJCC/UICC, especially regarding lymph node distribution and nomenclature.[35] \n",
      "Treatment of esophageal cancer varies by disease stage.[36] Patients with stage I disease—particularly Tis and T1aN0 by endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS)—may be considered for endoscopic therapy, such as endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) or endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), performed at a center with experience in these techniques. \n",
      "In patients with T1b and any N, surgery may be the initial treatment; however, patients with stages beyond T1b should undergo multidisciplinary evaluation and be considered for multimodality therapy. \n",
      "Trimodality (chemoradiation followed by surgery) is the recommended treatment for patients who can tolerate this regimen; this option is supported by strong level 1 evidence.[37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42] In fact, 15-30% of patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiation will have a complete pathologic response (pCR), meaning that the tumor will have completely disappeared when the esophagus is examined after surgery. Patients with a pCR have a 3-year survival rate of approximately 50%, as opposed to 27% for those without a pCR.[43] \n",
      "Preoperative chemotherapy followed by surgery is another option. However, the evidence for this approach is weak; the chance of increase in 2-year overall survival is less than 6%, compared with approximately 13% with trimodality therapy. \n",
      "Stage IV disease is treated with chemotherapy or symptomatic and supportive care, as indicated. For patients who, because of their clinical condition or owing to advanced disease, are not candidates for curative treatment, the goal of therapy is palliation of dysphagia, so that these patients can eat. No single method of palliation is best for every situation. Most patients require more than 1 kind of palliative treatment to sustain esophageal patency during the course of their disease. \n",
      "Surgery remains the cornerstone of treatment for esophageal cancer. Indications for surgery include the following:\n",
      "Esophageal cancer in a patient who is a candidate for surgery\n",
      "High-grade dysplasia in a patient with Barrett esophagus that cannot be adequately treated endoscopically[1, 2] \n",
      "Contraindications to surgery include the following:\n",
      "Metastasis to N2 nodes (ie, cervical or supraclavicular lymph nodes) or solid organs (eg, liver, lungs); the treatment of patients with celiac lymph node involvement remains controversial[44] \n",
      "Invasion of adjacent structures (eg, the recurrent laryngeal nerve, tracheobronchial tree, aorta, pericardium)\n",
      "In addition, the presence of severe, associated comorbid conditions (eg, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease) can decrease a patient's chances of surviving an esophageal resection. Consequently, cardiac and respiratory function must be carefully evaluated preoperatively. A forced expiratory volume in 1 second of less than 1.2 L and a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 0.4 are relative contraindications to the operation. \n",
      "Esophageal resection (esophagectomy) remains a critical component of multimodality therapy for patients with tumors of any stage. Endoscopic mucosal resection is an experimental approach to patients with T1a disease or high-grade dysplasia that is limited to certain centers and performed only under protocol. Esophagectomy is no longer is used for palliation of symptoms because other treatment modalities have become available for relieving dysphagia. \n",
      "An esophagectomy can be performed by using an abdominal and a cervical incision with blunt mediastinal dissection through the esophageal hiatus (ie, transhiatal esophagectomy [THE]) or by using an abdominal and a right thoracic incision (ie, transthoracic esophagectomy [TTE]). \n",
      "THE offers the advantage of avoiding a chest incision, which can cause prolonged discomfort and can further aggravate the condition of patients with compromised respiratory function. After removal of the esophagus, continuity of the gastrointestinal tract is usually reestablished using the stomach. \n",
      "Some authors have questioned the validity of THE as a cancer operation because part of the operation is not performed under direct vision and fewer lymph nodes are removed than with TTE. However, many retrospective studies and 2 prospective ones have shown no difference in survival between the operations, suggesting that the factor influencing survival is not the type of operation but, rather, the stage of the cancer at the time the operation is performed.[24, 25, 45, 46, 47, 48] \n",
      "Complications from esophagectomy occur in approximately 40% of patients. The morbidity associated with the surgery consists mostly of respiratory, cardiac, and septic complications, including the following: \n",
      "Respiratory complications (15-20%) - Include atelectasis, pleural effusion, and pneumonia\n",
      "Cardiac complications (15-20%) - Include cardiac arrhythmias and myocardial infarction\n",
      "Septic complications (10%) - Include wound infection, anastomotic leak (breakdown of the new connection between the stomach and esophagus), and pneumonia \n",
      "Anastomotic leaks and stricture may require dilatation (20%). Leaks may be treated with endoscopic placement of self-expanding, removable plastic stents.[49] \n",
      "Leak rates vary depending on whether the anastomosis was performed in the chest (3-12%) or the neck (10-25%).[50] The choice of location for the anastomosis is based mostly on the location of the tumor and the surgeon’s assessment of the risks and benefits of a thoracic anastomosis. Such anastomoses have a lower leak rate, but an intrathoracic leak following esophagectomy can lead to sepsis and death. \n",
      "A retrospective review of 1223 esophagectomies for cancer found that surgical management of intrathoracic leaks did not increase the patient mortality rate or effect long-term survival.[50] \n",
      "As with other complex operations (eg, cardiac operations, resection of the pancreas or liver), the lowest mortality rate with esophagectomy is achieved when the procedure is performed in high-volume centers by high-volume surgeons. In California from 1990-1994, for instance, 5 high-volume centers had a mortality rate of 5% or less for esophageal resection for cancer, while the state’s average mortality rate for this surgery was approximately 18%.[51] \n",
      "The better results in high-volume centers are due to a team approach. In these facilities, expert surgeons work with intensivists, cardiologists, pulmonologists, radiologists, and nurses who have experience and expertise. \n",
      "For TTE, the patient is placed supine on the operating room table. An arterial line, a central venous catheter, a Foley catheter, and a dual-lumen endotracheal tube are placed. Preoperative antibiotics are administered. An upper midline incision is made. \n",
      "After exploring the peritoneal cavity for metastatic disease (if metastases are found, the operation is not continued), the stomach is mobilized. The right gastric and the right gastroepiploic arteries are preserved, while the short gastric vessels and the left gastric artery are divided. \n",
      "Next, the gastroesophageal junction is mobilized, and the esophageal hiatus is enlarged. A pyloromyotomy is performed, and a feeding jejunostomy is placed for postoperative nutritional support. \n",
      "After closure of the abdominal incision, the patient is repositioned in the left lateral decubitus position and a right posterolateral thoracotomy is performed in the fifth intercostal space. \n",
      "The azygos vein is divided to allow full mobilization of the esophagus. The stomach is delivered into the chest through the hiatus and is then divided approximately 5 cm below the gastroesophageal junction. \n",
      "An anastomosis (hand-sewn or stapled) is performed between the esophagus and the stomach at the apex of the right chest cavity. Then, the chest incision is closed. \n",
      "For THE, the preoperative details are similar to those of TTE, except that a single-lumen, rather than a double-lumen, endotracheal tube is used. The neck is prepared in the operative field. \n",
      "The abdominal part of the operation is identical to the TTE; however, dissection of the esophagus is performed through the enlarged esophageal hiatus without opening the right chest. The esophagus is mobilized in this fashion all the way to the thoracic inlet. \n",
      "Then, a 6-cm incision is made in the left side of the neck. The internal jugular vein and carotid artery are retracted laterally, and the esophagus is identified and isolated posterior to the airway. To prevent injury to the left recurrent laryngeal nerve, no mechanical retractors are used to retract the trachea. \n",
      "Next, after resection of the proximal stomach and thoracic esophagus, the remaining stomach is pulled up through the posterior mediastinum until it reaches the remaining esophagus at the cervical level. Then, a hand-sewn anastomosis is performed, and a small drain is placed in the neck alongside the anastomosis. The abdominal and neck incisions are closed. (See the image below.)\n",
      "The use of laparoscopic and thoracoscopic techniques has revolutionized the treatment of benign esophageal disorders such as achalasia and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Advantages of minimally invasive surgery include a shorter hospital stay, less postoperative discomfort, and much faster recovery time than with open surgery. These techniques are finding a place in the treatment of esophageal cancer.[52] \n",
      "Video-assisted thoracoscopy (VATS) is being used in many centers for the thoracic mobilization of the esophagus, reducing the size of the chest incision. In addition, laparoscopy can be used to mobilize the gastric conduit in the abdomen, reducing abdominal incision size as well. \n",
      "A study by Uenosono et al found that sentinel node mapping can be applied to patients with clinical T1 and N0 esophageal cancer. Use of this technique may facilitate less invasive surgery, with reduction of lymphadenectomy.[53] \n",
      "Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) is a modern, attractive option for the treatment of superficial esophageal cancers. High-grade dysplasia and mucosa-limited neoplasms are candidates for EMR, because of the low risk of node metastasis in these cases. A population-based study of 1618 patients with grade Tis, T1a, or T1b esophageal cancer found that overall survival times and esophageal-cancer-specific survival times with endoscopic therapy were similar to those with surgery, after adjustment for patient and tumor factors.[54, 55] \n",
      "In patients with local failure after definitive chemoradiotherapy (CRT) for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), salvage endoscopic treatment (SET) may be a viable option, according to a study reported at the 2014 Gastrointestinal Cancers Symposium.[56] The study included 716 ESCC patients treated with CRT, 417 of whom experienced local failure (incomplete response or local recurrence); of these 417 patients, 164 underwent SET (either photodynamic therapy or endoscopic resection). \n",
      "Curative resection was achieved in 88% of the patients who underwent endoscopic resection, and a complete response was achieved in 57.5% of those who underwent photodynamic therapy.[56] Overall survival and relapse-free survival rates at 5 years were 38.6% and 28%, respectively. The factors most strongly predictive of improved survival were (1) an absence of lymph node metastasis before CRT and (2) an elapsed time of 6 months or longer between the initiation of CRT and the performance of SET.[56] \n",
      "Chemotherapy and radiotherapy for esophageal cancer are delivered preoperatively. No survival benefit is obtained when radiation and chemotherapy are administered postoperatively; however, postoperative continuance of chemotherapy started preoperatively may be beneficial.[57] The aims of preoperative (neoadjuvant) chemotherapy and radiotherapy are to reduce the bulk of the primary tumor before surgery to facilitate higher curative resection rates and to eliminate or delay the appearance of distant metastases. \n",
      "Most chemotherapy that is currently used for the treatment of esophageal cancer, including alkylating, antimetabolite, anthracycline, and antimicrotubular agents, are not approved for this indication by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Chemotherapy for squamous cell esophageal carcinoma, as with squamous cell carcinomas in general, is based on cisplatin, while chemotherapy for esophageal adenocarcinoma has been extrapolated from experience in patients with adenocarcinoma of the stomach. \n",
      "Neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone appears to offer a limited benefit at best. A North American randomized trial found that preoperative chemotherapy with a combination of cisplatin and fluorouracil did not improve overall survival among patients with squamous cell cancer or adenocarcinoma of the esophagus. In a larger trial, British investigators found that preoperative chemotherapy with those 2 agents resulted in a 5-year survival rate of 23.0%, compared with 17.1% for surgery alone.[58] \n",
      "In contrast, the Chemoradiotherapy for Oesophageal Cancer Followed by Surgery Study (CROSS) demonstrated considerable benefit from preoperative chemoradiation over surgery alone in selected patients with esophageal or esophagogastric-junction cancer (tumor stage T1N1 or T2–T3 with any N).[59] Median overall survival with chemoradiation therapy followed by surgery was 49.4 months, compared with 24.0 months with surgery alone.\n",
      "An analysis of data from CROSS I and II showed that preoperative chemoradiotherapy (CRT) plus surgery was superior to surgery alone in preventing local, regional, and distant recurrence, particularly hematogenous metastasis and peritoneal carcinomatosis.[60, 61, 62] Overall recurrence rates were 35% for CRT plus surgery and 58% for surgery alone. The rates of locoregional recurrence, peritoneal carcinomatosis, and hematogenous dissemination were all lower for the former as well (14% vs 34%, 4% vs 14%, and 29% vs 35%, respectively).\n",
      "Neoadjuvant therapy consists of a combination of radiotherapy (approximately 45 Gy) and chemotherapy with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil. While the radiotherapy acts locally at the tumor site, the chemotherapy acts on tumor cells that have already spread. This combination therapy is usually administered over a 45-day period; esophageal resection is performed after an interval of approximately 4 weeks. \n",
      "Rohatgi et al reported that the response to preoperative chemoradiotherapy correlated strongly with overall survival and disease-free survival in patients with esophageal cancer. In their review of 235 cases, survival decreased progressively between patients who achieved a pathologic complete response, those who had a partial response (1-50% residual carcinoma in the resected specimen), and those with no response (greater than 50% residual carcinoma).[63] \n",
      "A study by Rao et al identified groups of esophageal tumors with distinct gene expression profiles, which in future may allow for tailored treatment protocols.[64] Similarly, Alexander et al identified DNA-repair biomarkers that predict response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.[65] \n",
      "A trial involving 111 patients undergoing chemoradiotherapy for head-and-neck or esophageal cancer indicated that enteral nutrition enriched with n-3 fatty acids helps to preserve body mass and improve nutritional and functional status parameters during chemoradiotherapy.[66, 67] \n",
      "In patients who, because of their clinical condition or advanced disease, are not candidates for surgery, treatment focuses on control of dysphagia. The most appropriate method to control dysphagia should be determined for each patient individually, depending on tumor characteristics, patient preference, and the specific expertise of the physician. \n",
      "The following treatment modalities are available to help achieve this goal:\n",
      "Chemotherapy\n",
      "Radiotherapy\n",
      "Laser therapy\n",
      "Stents[68] \n",
      "Chemotherapy as a single modality has limited use. Only a few patients achieve a modest and short-lived response.\n",
      "A phase 3 study from the United Kingdom suggests that docetaxel may be useful as a second-line treatment for patients with esophageal cancer who have progressed after first-line chemotherapy.[69, 70] Median overall survival was significantly better in patients treated with docetaxel than in those managed with active symptom control (5.2 versus 3.6 months, respectively). \n",
      "Because survival in these patients is measured in months, quality of life is an important consideration. In the UK study, quality-of-life questionnaires demonstrated no differences between the 2 groups on global and functioning scores but did indicate an improvement in symptom scores, with the docetaxel group reporting less pain.[69, 70] \n",
      "In 2006, a Cochrane review tried to assess the effectiveness of chemotherapy versus best supportive care, as well as that of different chemotherapy regimens against each other, in metastatic esophageal carcinoma. The authors found that no consistent benefit with any specific chemotherapy regimen.[71] Cisplatin, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), paclitaxel, and anthracyclines had promising response rates and tolerable toxicity. \n",
      "Radiation therapy is successful in relieving dysphagia in approximately 50% of patients. In patients with advanced esophageal cancer, the preoperative combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy has shown good results.\n",
      "In a large, multicenter study, Herskovic and colleagues reported a 2-year survival rate of 38%, with a median survival period of 12.5 months, for patients treated with radiotherapy in combination with chemotherapy (fluorouracil and cisplatin), compared with a 2-year-survival rate of 10% and a median survival period of 8.5 months in patients treated with radiotherapy alone.[68, 72] \n",
      "In a study, Folkert et al found that high-dose-rate (HDR) endoluminal brachytherapy was well tolerated in medically inoperable patients with superficial primary or recurrent esophageal cancer. Over the course of 3 years, 14 patients were treated with HDR intraluminal brachytherapy; 10 had recurrent esophageal cancer and 4 had previously unirradiated lesions. The overall freedom from failure (OFFF) and the overall survival (OS) rate at 18 months were 30.8% and 72.7%, respectively. Patients with recurrent disease had an 11.1% OFFF and a 55.6% OS rate at 18 months. For patients with previously unirradiated disease, the OFFF was 75% and the OS rate was 100%.[73] \n",
      "Laser therapy (Nd:YAG laser) can help to achieve temporary relief of dysphagia in as many as 70% of patients. Multiple sessions are usually required to keep the esophageal lumen patent. The photosensitizer porfimer (Photofrin) is FDA approved for palliation of patients with completely obstructing esophageal cancer or partially obstructing cancer that cannot be satisfactorily treated with Nd:YAG laser therapy. Intravenous injection of porfimer is followed 40–50 hours later with delivery of 630 nm wavelength laser light; a second laser light treatment may be given 96–120 hours after the injection. \n",
      "Patients may be intubated with expandable metallic stents, which can be deployed by endoscopy under fluoroscopic guidance and can keep the esophageal lumen patent. Stents are particularly useful for patients with a tracheoesophageal fistula.\n",
      "The average length of postoperative hospital stay for patients with esophageal cancer is 9-14 days. Patients usually spend the first postoperative night in the intensive care unit (ICU). \n",
      "Patients can be extubated immediately after the operation, but mechanical ventilation should be continued if any concerns about the respiratory status are present. Respiratory complications (eg, atelectasis, pleural effusion, pneumonia) and cardiac complications (eg, cardiac arrhythmias) usually occur in the first postoperative days. Patients leave the ICU and are transferred to the surgical ward only when their respiratory status and cardiac status are satisfactory. \n",
      "Feeding through the feeding jejunostomy begins on postoperative day 1. On postoperative day 6, a swallow study is performed to check for anastomotic leakage. If no leak is present, patients start oral feedings. If a leak is present, the drainage tubes are left in place and nutrition is provided entirely through the feeding jejunostomy until the leak closes spontaneously. \n",
      "Approximately 85-90% of patients go home after discharge. The remaining patients may need additional time in a skilled nursing facility if they live alone and if they cannot take care of themselves. \n",
      "Patients are seen by the responsible surgeon at 2 weeks and 4 weeks after discharge from the hospital and subsequently every 6 months by an oncologist. Most patients return to their regular level of activities within 2 months. \n",
      "For squamous cell carcinoma, prevention consists of smoking cessation, efforts to reduce alcohol abuse, and consumption of a diet containing an adequate amount of fruits, vegetables, and vitamins. For esophageal adenocarcinomas, prevention involves stopping the sequence of events leading from gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) to Barrett esophagus to adenocarcinoma. \n",
      "Better control of gastroesophageal reflux can prevent the development of Barrett metaplasia in patients with GERD and can discourage the development of high-grade dysplasia in patients with metaplasia. Endoscopic follow-up evaluations should be performed at 1- to 2-year intervals to detect the presence of dysplasia, allowing intervention before cancer develops. \n",
      "Dysplasia in Barrett esophagus can be treated with endoscopic ablation, using radiofrequency ablation (RFA), photodynamic therapy (PDT), or cryotherapy. \n",
      "If high-grade dysplasia does develop, esophagectomy is indicated. The operation must be performed by experienced surgeons in high-volume centers in order to keep the mortality rate at less than 5%. \n",
      "RFA has been gaining popularity as a treatment for Barrett esophagus with dysplasia. Shaheen et al reported complete eradication of all dysplasia 2 years after RFA in 101 of 106 patients (95%). After 3 years, dysplasia remained eradicated in more than 85% of patients, without maintenance RFA. The rate of serious adverse events was 3.4%, and the rate of esophageal stricture was 7.6%.[74] \n",
      "PDT involves the administration of photosensitizing chromophores, which are selectively retained by dysplastic malignant tissue. Light is then delivered in the area. The photosensitizer absorbs photons, becomes photoexcited, and transfers its energy to a chemical substrate that causes biologic damage to the abnormal tissue. A drawback of PDT is the formation of esophageal strictures in 34% of patients. The photosensitizer porfimer is FDA approved for ablation of high-grade dysplasia in Barrett esophagus. \n",
      "Chemotherapy of squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus, like squamous cell malignancies in general, is based on cisplatin. The chemotherapeutic choices in esophageal adenocarcinoma have been extrapolated from chemotherapy experience in patients with adenocarcinoma of the stomach. Most of the chemotherapy regimens currently used for the treatment of esophageal cancer, including alkylating, antimetabolite, anthracycline, and antimicrotubular agents, have not been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). \n",
      "These agents inhibit cell growth and proliferation. They interfere with DNA synthesis by blocking the methylation of deoxyuridylic acid. \n",
      "Fluorouracil is a pyrimidine antimetabolite. Several mechanisms of action have been proposed, including inhibition of thymidylate synthase and inhibition of RNA synthesis. This agent is also a potent radiosensitizer.\n",
      "Capecitabine is a pyrimidine antimetabolite and a prodrug of fluorouracil. It forms the active moiety, fluorouracil, by undergoing hydrolysis in the liver and tissues. Capecitabine is used for the treatment of esophageal cancer, which is an off-label indication. \n",
      "These agents inhibit cell growth and proliferation, interfering with DNA synthesis by the formation of DNA cross-links. Alkylating agents can have serious adverse effects such as bone marrow suppression, anaphylactic-like reactions, ototoxicity, renal toxicity, and vomiting. \n",
      "Intrastrand cross-linking of DNA and inhibition of DNA precursors are among the proposed mechanisms of action for cisplatin. This agent is used in combination with radiation therapy. Cisplatin has black box warnings for adverse reactions, including anaphylactic-like reactions, ototoxicity, and renal toxicity.\n",
      "Carboplatin is a platinum alkylating agent that interferes with the function of DNA by producing interstrand DNA cross-links. It can be used in combination with paclitaxel for the treatment of esophageal cancer, which is an off-label indication. Carboplatin has black box warnings including bone marrow suppression, anaphylactic reactions, and vomiting. \n",
      "Oxaliplatin is a platinum alkylating agent that inhibits DNA replication and transcription, resulting in cell death. It can be used in combination chemotherapy for the treatment of esophageal cancer, which is an off-label indication. It has a black box warning for anaphylactic reactions, which can be managed with epinephrine, corticosteroids, and antihistamines. \n",
      "These agents prevent cell growth and proliferation. They work by enhancing tubulin dimers, stabilizing existing microtubules, and inhibiting microtubule disassembly. \n",
      "Docetaxel inhibits the depolymerization of tubulin, which inhibits DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis. It can be used in combination with cisplatin and fluorouracil for the treatment of esophageal cancer, which is an off-label indication. It has several black box warnings such as bone marrow suppression, fluid retention, and hypersensitivity reactions.\n",
      "Use of docetaxel is not recommended in certain patients with hepatic impairment. Patients receiving treatment with docetaxel should be premedicated with corticosteroids the day before administration to help reduce fluid retention and hypersensitivity reactions. \n",
      "Paclitaxel promotes microtubule assembly, interferes with the G2 mitotic phase, and inhibits cell replication. Although not FDA approved, it has been used in combination chemotherapy for the treatment of esophageal cancer. Paclitaxel has an off-label indication for the treatment of adenocarcinoma. Black box warnings for this drug include bone marrow suppression and hypersensitivity reactions. \n",
      "Anthracycline antineoplastics inhibit DNA and RNA synthesis by steric obstruction. They intercalate between DNA base pairs and trigger DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II. \n",
      "Epirubicin inhibits DNA and RNA synthesis. It can be used off label as part of a combination chemotherapy regimen for the treatment of esophageal cancer. It has several black box warnings, including bone marrow suppression, extravasation, myocardial toxicity, and secondary malignancy. Dosage reduction is recommended in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.\n",
      "These agents prevent cell growth and proliferation. They work by binding to topoisomerase and causing single-strand DNA breaks.\n",
      "Irinotecan binds reversibly to the topoisomerase I–DNA complex and prevents the ligation of the cleaved DNA strand. It can be used as part of combination chemotherapy for the treatment of esophageal cancer, which is an off-label indication. Black box warnings for irinotecan include bone marrow suppression and diarrhea.\n",
      "This category includes miscellaneous antineoplastic agents that cause cytotoxic activity by various mechanisms of action.\n",
      "Porfimer is a photodynamic therapy that causes cytotoxic activity by producing oxygen free-radicals in the presence of laser light. It also can release thromboxane A2, leading to necrosis and vascular occlusion. It is indicated for palliation in patients with partially or completely obstructing esophageal cancer.\n",

      "Bipolar affective disorder, or manic-depressive illness (MDI), is a common, severe, and persistent mental illness. This condition is a serious lifelong struggle and challenge.[1] Other mental disorders and general medical conditions are more prevalent in patients with bipolar disorders than in patients in the general population.[5] Among the general comorbid conditions, cardiometabolic conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity are a common source of morbidity and mortality for persons with bipolar disorder. \n",
      "Bipolar disorder is characterized by periods of deep, prolonged, and profound depression that alternate with periods of an excessively elevated or irritable mood known as mania. This pattern of alternating severe depression and periods of mania is characteristic of bipolar disorder type I (BPI), although in rarer cases, persons may only experience episodes of mania. In practice, symptoms of mania and depression can also occur together in what is termed a mixed state as the illness evolves. By contrast, bipolar disorder type II (BPII) is diagnosed when episodes of severe depression are punctuated with periods of hypomania, a less severe form of mania that does not include psychosis or lead to gross impairment in functioning. A diagnosis of cyclothymic disorder is given to individuals with periods of both hypomanic and depressive symptoms without meeting the full criteria for mania, hypomania or major depression. \n",
      "The symptoms of mania include decreased sleep time accompanied by a decreased need for sleep, pressured speech, increased libido, reckless behavior without regard for consequences, grandiosity, and severe thought disturbances, which may or may not include psychosis. Between these highs and lows, many patients, if adequately medicated, usually experience periods of higher functionality and can lead a productive life. \n",
      "Unipolar (major depressive) disorder and bipolar disorder share depressive symptoms, but bipolar disorder is defined by episodes of mania or hypomania. A community lifetime prevalence of 4% for BPI and BPII disorder combined has been suggested. The costs of bipolar disorder include the direct costs of treatment along with the even more significant indirect costs of excess unemployment, decreased productivity, and excess mortality; it is a severely impairing illness that affects many aspects of patients' lives.[6] \n",
      "In the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, (DSM-5), bipolar disorder constitutes a spectrum of mood disorders that includes BPI, BPII, cyclothymiaand are thought to be a “bridge” between schizophrenia spectrum disorders and depressive disorders in terms of the symptomology, family history and genetics.[2] \n",
      "The pathophysiology of bipolar affective disorder, or manic-depressive illness (MDI), has not been determined, and no objective biologic markers correspond definitively with the disease state. However, twin, family, and adoption studies all indicate that bipolar disorder has a significant genetic component. In fact, first-degree relatives of a person with bipolar disorder are approximately 7 times more likely to develop bipolar disorder than the rest of the population, and the heritability of bipolar I disorder (BPI) has recently been estimated at 0.73.[7] \n",
      "The genetic component of bipolar disorder appears to be complex: The condition is likely to be caused by multiple different common disease alleles, each of which contributes a relatively low degree of risk on its own. Such disease genes can be difficult to find without very large sample sizes, on the order of thousands of subjects. \n",
      "When the genetics of bipolar disorder were first being studied, less precise tools were available, but they still yielded interesting information. Many loci are now known to be associated with the development of bipolar disorder. These loci are grouped as major affective disorder (MAFD) loci and numbered in the order of their discovery. \n",
      "\n",
      "MAFD loci\n",
      "\n",
      "MAFD1 is located at 18p and was originally described in a group of 22 patients with bipolar disorder.[8] MAFD2 is located at Xq28 and, as such, is associated with an X-linked inheritance pattern. The notion of an X-linked form of bipolar disorder is not a new one, and at least one paper from the pregenetic era discusses this very possibility.[9] MAFD3 is located at 21q22.13, and the association appears to be with the TRPM2 gene.[10, 11] MAFD4 is located at 16p12 and has been associated with susceptibility to bipolar disease in a cohort of 41 Finnish families.[12] \n",
      "MAFD5 is located at 2q22-q24, and MAFD6 is located at 6q23-24. Interestingly, evidence suggests a strong interaction between genes located in these 2 regions. It has been concluded that the candidate gene in the MAFD5 locus shows epistatic interaction with the MAFD6 risk locus.[13] MAFD7 is located at 22q12.1 and was detected using microsatellite markers in a North American population; a large region on 22q12 was associated with bipolar disorder in this study.[14] Further study in this region showed a polymorphism in the promoter region of the XBP1 gene, which also showed susceptibility to bipolar disorder in a Japanese cohort.[15] XBP1 appears to be involved mainly in immune system function; thus,its influence on the susceptibility of bipolar disorder is not understood. \n",
      "MAFD8 is located at 10q21, and its discovery is the result of a large analysis of over 1.8 million variants in 4387 cases of bipolar disorder.[16] The association in this study appears to be with the ANK3 gene, which is a gene of marked interest and is therefore discussed at length below.[16] MAFD9 is located at 12p13.3, and its discovery is the result of the same large analysis as MAFD8. The association in this study appears to be with the CACNA1C gene.[16] Like ANK3, it remains a gene of interest[17] and is also mentioned below. \n",
      "\n",
      "Genome-wide association studies\n",
      "\n",
      "The first series of genome-wide association studies (GWASs) for bipolar disorder were published in 2007 and 2008,[18, 19, 20, 16] and a collaborative analysis of the last 3 studies gave combined support for 2 particular genes, ANK3 (ankyrin G) and CACNA1C (alpha 1C subunit of the L-type voltage-gated calcium channel) in a sample of 4387 cases and 6209 controls.[16] ANK3 is an adaptor protein found at axon initial segments that regulates the assembly of voltage-gated sodium channels. Both ANK3 and subunits of the calcium channel are downregulated in mouse brain in response to lithium, which indicates a possible therapeutic mechanism of action of one of the most effective treatments for bipolar disorder.[21] \n",
      "Further evidence for association of bipolar disorder to CACNA1C was reported in 2011 in an ever-growing sample (numbering 11,974 bipolar disorder cases and 51,792 controls at the time of the report), providing overwhelming support for this gene as a bipolar susceptibility locus.[17] \n",
      "CACNA1C, on chromosome 12, encodes the alpha subunit of the L-type voltage-gated calcium ion channel found in the brain. L-type calcium channel blockers have been used to treat bipolar disorder, and there has been speculation that at least some mood stabilizers may mediate their effects via modulating calcium channel signaling in bipolar illness. \n",
      "A joint analysis of the bipolar GWAS data was carried out, including GWAS data from another large-scale study of schizophrenia published in the same issue. Again, both ANK3 and CACNA1C came up positive in the combined data set, suggesting a shared genetic basis for these disorders. A previous National Institutes of Health (NIH) report on GWASs also underscored that bipolar disorder and schizophrenia could indeed share common susceptibility genes on chromosome 6.[22] These data herald future revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision, (DSM-IV-TR) according to an etiologic rather than descriptive basis. \n",
      "In 2013, the Cross-Disorder Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium published results of their large GWAS study of psychiatric disorders, reporting that specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are associated with range of childhood- or adult-onset psychiatric disorders.[23] The study comprised a combined sample of 33,332 persons with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, attention deficit disorder and autism spectrum disorders and 27,888 controls of European ancestry.[23] \n",
      "Specific expression of common genetic variants at different times during development, or in different regions of the brain, and in concert with other genetic variants could help to explain differences in disease phenotypes. Genetic markers in 4 regions were associated with all 5 disorders, including variants in the CACNA1C gene, another gene for an L-type voltage-gated calcium channel subunit, CACNB2, and markers on chromosomes 3p21 and 10q24.[23] Although specific variants from CACNA1C showed the strongest association when only samples from individuals with bipolar disorder, major depression and schizophrenia were evaluated, the majority of regions seemed to be associated with all 5 disorders, suggesting that common risk alleles contribute to each phenotype, an effect described as pleiotropy. As noted by the authors, although CACNB2 was not identified in previous GWASs of a combined bipolar and schizophrenia sample, it was one of the main signals detected in an independentGWASs of Han Chinese individuals with bipolar disorder.[23] \n",
      "Although the first GWAS of bipolar disorder used a much smaller sample size than subsequent attempts, including an initial sample of 461 patients with bipolar disorder from the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) consortium and a follow-up sample of 563 patients collected in Germany, it still yielded interesting observations that will need to be followed up in the larger samples mentioned earlier.[18] For example, the strongest association signals were detected in genes also involved in biochemical pathways regulated by lithium. The strongest hit was at a marker within the first intron of diacylglycerol kinase eta (DGKH) gene. DGKH is a key protein in the lithium-sensitive phosphatidyl inositol pathway. \n",
      "Three of the other associated genes in this study also interact with the Wnt signaling pathway upstream and downstream of glycogen synthase kinase 3-beta (GSK3β). Lithium-mediated inhibition of GSK3β is thought to result in downregulation of molecules involved in cell death and upregulation of neuroprotective factors. \n",
      "Additionally, GSK3β is a central regulator of the circadian clock, and lithium-mediated modulation of circadian periodicity is thought to be a critical component of lithium’s therapeutic effect. In fact, another major coup for bipolar disorder research has been the finding that a dominant-negative mutation in the CLOCK gene normally contributing to circadian periodicity in humans results in maniclike behavior in mice,[24] including hyperactivity, decreased sleep, reduced anxiety, and an increased response to cocaine. The latter finding also provides a shared biologic basis for the high rate of substance abuse observed in clinical populations of subjects with bipolar disorder. \n",
      "Furthermore, the experimenters were able to abolish the manic behaviors by rescuing expression of normal CLOCK specifically in the ventral tegmental area of the mouse brain.[25] This area is rich in D2 receptors. Joseph Coyle hypothesized in his commentary in the paper on the same issue that the efficacy of atypical antipsychotics in acute mania might, in part, be achieved by their ability to lower activity in neurons specifically within the ventral tegmental area.[26] \n",
      "Although large-scale association studies of bipolar disorder are beginning to yield results, one of the greatest obstacles to finding genes for such complex behavior is the imprecision inherent in diagnosis of the disorder itself; objective criteria are lacking. Therefore, some of the most exciting recent research is focused on defining heritable, quantitative diagnostic measures that capture specific features of bipolar disorder (termed endophenotypes) to refine the search for responsible genes.[27] Such promising measures for bipolar disorder include structural brain phenotypes, sleep and activity measures, neurocognitive measures, and gene expression studies.[28] This collaborative research effort under the aegis of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) has been termed the Bipolar Phenome Project.[29] \n",
      "Newer GWASs continue to find additional genes of interest which appear to be associated with an increased risk of bipolar disorder. One study showed an association between bipolar disorder and the NCAN gene.[30] This gene is expressed in the brain and is involved in the migration of cells within the brain. In a mouse model, it was observed that the NCAN product is most prevalent in the hippocampus. There was no phenotypic defect in NCAN -deficient mice, but subtle effects could not be excluded.[30] \n",
      "Although most of the present research does not stratify by sex, a recent study looked at association between estrogen receptor binding site variation with bipolar disorder in females. In particular, the association is with the transglutaminase 2 (TGM2) gene, which is known to be under estrogenic control.[31] This is further evidence of the heterogeneity of bipolar disorder and also presents evidence to explain the differences in the epidemiology of bipolar disorder between women and men.\n",
      "Of additional interest, a number of studies suggest that certain large copy number variants (greater than 100 kb) (includes both deletions and duplications) are associated with psychiatric disease, with bipolar disease and schizophrenia being the most commonly associated.[32] The implication is that possession of one of these copy number variants may modify the phenotype to those who are at risk of psychiatric disease.[32] \n",
      "When investigators looked at microarray results for 1001 patients with bipolar disorder and 1033 controls to quantify the risk of deletions throughout the genome for patients with bipolar disorder, they found that 16.2% of patients with bipolar disorder had deletions, whereas 12.3% of controls had deletions. In addition, patients who had bipolar disorder and deletions more frequently had onset of mania before age 18 years.[4] \n",
      "\n",
      "Gene expression studies\n",
      "\n",
      "Gene expression studies are one way of measuring the relative activity or inactivity of genes, and they have already been proven useful for illuminating the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders, including bipolar disorder. For example, studies comparing specific regions of postmortem brain tissue from persons with bipolar disorder with tissue from control subjects have consistently shown that levels of expression of oligodendrocyte-myelin–related genes appear to be decreased in brain tissue from persons with bipolar disorder.[33, 34, 35, 36] As with genetic studies, gene expression profiling studies require very large sample sizes to produce replicable data. Furthermore, they must focus on the correct brain region(s) thought to be functioning differently in bipolar disorder, a point still under some debate. Therefore, research in this area is ongoing and frequently subject to update. \n",
      "Oligodendrocytes produce myelin membranes that wrap around and insulate axons to permit the efficient conduction of nerve impulses in the brain. Therefore, loss of myelin is thought to disrupt communication between neurons, leading to some of the thought disturbances observed in bipolar disorder and related illnesses. Brain imaging studies of persons with bipolar disorder also show abnormal myelination in several brain regions associated with this illness.[37, 38] It can be useful to compare data from gene expression studies with brain imaging studies of persons with bipolar disorder to determine whether abnormalities of structure or function correlate with changes in gene expression. In this case, structural neuroimaging studies also show abnormal myelination in several brain regions associated with bipolar disorder.[37, 38] Of note, many widely used psychotropic treatments including those for bipolar disorder share signaling pathways that affect myelination, its plasticity, andrepair;such pathways may promote myelination of neurons.[39] \n",
      "Interestingly, gene expression and neuroimaging studies of persons with schizophrenia and major depression also demonstrate similar findings, indicating that mood disorders and schizophrenia may share some biologic underpinnings, possibly related to psychosis. These types of data may also lead to the future revision of psychiatric diagnostic manuals based on a new understanding of the etiology of these disorders. \n",
      "Another approach to delineating the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder involves studying changes in gene expression induced in rodent brains after administration of pharmacologic agents used to treat bipolar disorder. For example, investigators have demonstrated that 2 chemically unrelated drugs (lithium and valproate) used to treat bipolar disorder both upregulate the expression of the cytoprotective protein Bcl-2 in the frontal cortex and the hippocampus of rat brains.[40] These types of studies are also performed on human tissue by exposing cultured monocytes from peripheral blood to lithium and other factors. \n",
      "A postmortem study by Konradi et al of the hippocampus in both patients with bipolar disorder and healthy persons found that the 2 groups did not differ in the total number of hippocampal neurons.[41] However, patients with bipolar disorder had reduced volume of nonpyramidal cell layers, a reduced number of somatostatin-positive and parvalbumin positive neurons, a reduced somal volume in cornu ammonis sector 2/3, and reduced messenger RNA levels for somatostatin, parvalbumin, and glutamic acid decarboxylase 1. These findings suggest alteration of hippocampal interneurons in patients with bipolar disorder that might lead to hippocampal dysfunction. \n",
      "Neuroimaging studies of individuals with bipolar disorder or other mood disorders also suggest evidence of cell loss or atrophy in these same brain regions. Thus, another suggested cause of bipolar disorder is damage to cells in the critical brain circuitry that regulates emotion. According to this hypothesis, mood stabilizers and antidepressants are thought to alter mood by stimulating cell survival pathways and increasing levels of neurotrophic factors to improve cellular resiliency. In 2008, Mathew et al published a review of novel drugs and therapeutic targets for severe mood disorders that focus on increasing neuroplasticity and cellular resiliency.[42] \n",
      "Post et al had previously proposed a mechanism involving electrophysiologic kindling and behavioral sensitization processes, which resonates with the neuronal injury hypothesis.[24] They asserted that a person who is susceptible to bipolar disorder experiences an increasing number of minor neurologic insults—such as those induced by drugs of abuse, stress-related excessive glucocorticoid stimulation, oxidative or immune-mediated damage—that eventually resulting in mania that further compromises the injured neurons.[24] Sufficient brain damage might persist to cause mania to recur even with no or minor environmental or behavioral stressors. \n",
      "Post et al’s formulation helps explain the effective role of anticonvulsant medications (eg, carbamazepine and valproate) in the prevention of the highs and lows of bipolar disorder. It also supports clinical observations that the more episodes a person experiences, the more he or she will have in the future, underscoring the need for long-term treatment. \n",
      "For more information, see the Medscape Reference topic Genetics of Bipolar Disorder.\n",
      "A number of factors contribute to bipolar affective disorder, or manic-depressive illness (MDI), including genetic, biochemical, psychodynamic, and environmental factors. \n",
      "Bipolar disorder, especially bipolar type I (BPI) disorder, has a major genetic component, with the involvement of the ANK3,CACNA1C, and CLOCK genes.[18, 19, 20, 16, 17, 25, 43] The evidence indicating a genetic role in bipolar disorder takes several forms. \n",
      "First-degree relatives of people with BPI are approximately 7 times more likely to develop BPI than the general population. Remarkably, offspring of a parent with bipolar disorder have a 50% chance of having another major psychiatric disorder. One logitudinal study found that subthreshold manic or hypomanic episodes were a diagnostic risk factor for the development of subsequent manic, mixed, or hypomanic episodes in the offspring of parents with bipolar disorder. High-risk offspring, compared with offspring of parents without bipolar disorder, also had higher rates of ADHD, disruptive behavior disorders, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders.[44] \n",
      "Twin studies demonstrate a concordance of 33-90% for BPI in identical twins. As identical twins share 100% of their DNA, these studies also show that environmental factors are involved, and there is no guarantee that a person will develop bipolar disorder, even if they carry susceptibility genes.\n",
      "Adoption studies prove that a common environment is not the only factor that makes bipolar disorder occur in families. Children whose biologic parents have either BPI or a major depressive disorder remain at increased risk of developing an affective disorder, even if they are reared in a home with adopted parents who are not affected. Frey and colleagues’ work supports the genetic contributions in bipolar affective disorder.[45, 46] \n",
      "Using probands from the Maudsley Twin Register in London, Cardno and colleagues showed that schizophrenic, schizoaffective, and manic syndromes share genetic risk factors and that the genetic liability was the same for schizoaffective disorder as for the other 2 syndromes.[47] This finding suggests an independent genetic liability for psychosis shared by both mood and schizophrenia spectrum disorders, as Berrettini[48] previously speculated and that has been confirmed in the recent large-scale GWAS studies mentioned above.[17] \n",
      "Gene expression studies also demonstrate that persons with bipolar disorder, major depression, and schizophrenia share similar decreases in the expression of oligodendrocyte-myelin-related genes and abnormalities of white matter in various brain regions. \n",
      "Multiple biochemical pathways likely contribute to bipolar disorder, which is why detecting one particular abnormality is difficult. A number of neurotransmitters have been linked to this disorder, largely based on patients’ responses to psychoactive agents as in the following examples. \n",
      "The blood pressure drug reserpine, which depletes catecholamines from nerve terminals, was noted incidentally to cause depression. This led to the catecholamine hypothesis, which holds that an increase in epinephrine and norepinephrine causes mania and a decrease in epinephrine and norepinephrine causes depression. \n",
      "Drugs used to treat depression and drugs of abuse (eg, cocaine) that increase levels of monoamines, including serotonin, norepinephrine, or dopamine, can all potentially trigger mania, implicating all of these neurotransmitters in its etiology. Other agents that exacerbate mania include L-dopa, which implicates dopamine and serotonin-reuptake inhibitors, which in turn implicate serotonin. \n",
      "Evidence is mounting of the contribution of glutamate to both bipolar disorder and major depression. A postmortem study of the frontal lobes of individuals with these disorders revealed that the glutamate levels were increased.[49] \n",
      "Calcium channel blockers have been used to treat mania, which may also result from a disruption of intracellular calcium regulation in neurons as suggested by experimental and genetic data. The proposed disruption of calcium regulation may be caused by various neurologic insults, such as excessive glutaminergic transmission or ischemia. Interestingly, valproate specifically upregulates expression of a calcium chaperone protein, GRP 78, which may be one of its chief mechanisms of cellular protection. \n",
      "Hormonal imbalances and disruptions of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis involved in homeostasis and the stress response may also contribute to the clinical picture of bipolar disorder. \n",
      "In addition to structural neuroimaging studies that look for volumetric changes in brain regions regardless of brain activity, functional neuroimaging studies are performed to find regions of the brain, or specific cortical networks, that are either hypoactive or hyperactive in a particular illness. For example a meta-analysis by Houenou et al found decreased activation and diminution of gray matter in a cortical-cognitive brain network, which has been associated with the regulation of emotions in patients with bipolar disorder.[50] An increased activation in ventral limbic brain regions that mediate the experience of emotions and generation of emotional responses was also discovered. This provides evidence for functional and anatomic alterations in bipolar disorder in brain networks associated with the experience and regulation of emotions.[50] \n",
      "Many practitioners see the dynamics of manic-depressive illness as being linked through a single common pathway. They see the depression as the manifestation of losses (ie, the loss of self-esteem and the sense of worthlessness). Therefore, the mania serves as a defense against the feelings of depression. Melanie Klein was one of the major proponents of this formulation. \n",
      "A study by Barnett et al found that personality disturbances in extraversion, neuroticism, and openness are often noted in patients with bipolar disorder and may be enduring characteristics.[51] \n",
      "In some instances, the cycle may be directly linked to external stresses or the external pressures may serve to exacerbate some underlying genetic or biochemical predisposition. For example, pregnancy is a particular stress for women with a manic-depressive illness history and increases the possibility of postpartum psychosis.[52] \n",
      "Because of the nature of their work, certain individuals have periods of high demands followed by periods of few requirements. For example, a landscaper and gardener who was busy in the spring, summer, and fall became relatively inactive during the winter, except for plowing snow. Consequently, he appeared manic for a good part of the year, and then he would crash and hibernate during the cold months. \n",
      "The lifelong prevalence of bipolar affective disorder, or manic-depressive illness (MDI), including subsyndromal forms in the United States has been noted to range from 3.7% to 3.9%.[53] However, the prevalence in patients who present with depression is higher in primary care (21-26%) and psychiatric clinic settings (28-49%).[53] Studies also indicate differences in lifetime prevalence estimates for bipolar disorder type I (BPI) (1.0%), bipolar disorder type II (BPII) (1.1%), and subthreshold bipolar disorders (2.4-4.7%).[54] \n",
      "Globally, the lifelong prevalence rate of bipolar disorder is 0.3-1.5%. In cross-sectional, face-to-face household surveys of more than 61,000 adults across 11 countries, Merikangas et al, using the World Mental Health version of the World Health Organization Composite International Diagnostic Interview, version 3.0, determined that the aggregate lifetime prevalences were 0.6% for BPI, 0.4% for BPII, 1.4% for subthreshold bipolar disorder, and 2.4% for bipolar spectrum.[55] Yutzy and colleagues reported an increase in the prevalence of BPI and BPII in recent years.[56] This prevalence ranged from 0.4% to 1.6% between the mid 1970s and 2000; by the late 1990s to the 2000s, the prevalence had the climbed from approximately 5% to 7%.[56] \n",
      "The age of onset of bipolar disorder varies greatly. For both BPI and BPII, the age range is from childhood to 50 years, with a mean age of approximately 21 years. Most cases of bipolar disorder commence when individuals are aged 15-19 years. The second most frequent age range of onset is 20-24 years. \n",
      "Some patients diagnosed with recurrent major depression may indeed have bipolar disorder and go on to develop their first manic episode when older than 50 years. These individuals may have a family history of bipolar disorder. However, for most patients, the onset of mania in people older than 50 years should lead to an investigation for medical or neurologic disorders, such as cerebrovascular disease. \n",
      "For more information, see the Medscape Reference article Pediatric Bipolar Affective Disorder.\n",
      "BPI occurs equally in both sexes; however, rapid-cycling bipolar disorder (≥4 episodes/y) is more common in women than in men. The incidence of BPII is higher in females than in males. Most studies report a nearly equal male-to-female ratio in the prevalence of bipolar disorder; however, most studies also report an increased risk in women for BPII/hypomania, rapid cycling, and mixed episodes.[57] \n",
      "Bipolar affective disorder, or manic-depressive illness (MDI), has significant morbidity and mortality rates. In the United States, during the early part of the 1990s, the cost of lost productivity resulting from this disorder was estimated at approximately $15.5 billion annually. Approximately 25-50% of individuals with bipolar disorder attempt suicide, and 11% successfully commit suicide.\n",
      "Additionally, a 2011 study from the United Kingdom suggested that for patients with bipolar disorder, mortality 1 year after hospital discharge was also higher than that of the general population for natural causes, chiefly respiratory and circulatory disorders.[58] \n",
      "Patients with BPI fare worse than patients with a major depression. Within the first 2 years after the initial episode, 40-50% of these patients experience another manic attack. Only 50-60% of patients with BPI who are on lithium gain control of their symptoms. In 7% of these patients, symptoms do not recur, 45% of patients experience more episodes, and 40% go on to have a persistent disorder. Often, the cycling between depression and mania accelerates with age. \n",
      "Factors suggesting a worse prognosis include the following:\n",
      "Poor job history\n",
      "Substance abuse\n",
      "Psychotic features\n",
      "Depressive features between periods of mania and depression\n",
      "Evidence of depression\n",
      "Male sex\n",

      "Factors suggesting a better prognosis include the following:\n",
      "Length of manic phases (short duration)\n",
      "Late age of onset\n",
      "Few thoughts of suicide\n",
      "Few psychotic symptoms\n",
      "Few medical problems\n",
      "Treatment of patients with bipolar affective disorder, or manic-depressive illness (MDI), involves initial and ongoing patient education. To this end, a strong therapeutic alliance is essential. \n",
      "Educational efforts must be directed not only toward the patient but also toward their family and support system. Furthermore, evidence continues to mount that these educational efforts not only increase patient compliance and their knowledge of the disease, but also their quality of life.[59] \n",
      "An explanation of the biology of the disease must be provided. This decreases feelings of guilt and promotes medication compliance. Information should be provided on how to monitor the illness in terms of an appreciation of the early warning signs, reemergence, and symptoms. Recognition of changes can serve as a powerful preventive step. \n",
      "Education must also encompass the dangers of stressors. Helping the individual identify and work with stressors provides a critical aspect of patient and family awareness. Efforts should be made to educate the patient about relapses within the total context of the disorder. \n",
      "Individual stories help patients and families. The National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) has a story of a person with manic-depressive illness that can help the patient see the struggle and challenge from another perspective.[60] Others have written about their family struggles and challenges.[61] \n",

      "Correct diagnosis of a disorder leads to proper effective treatment. Nowhere is that more relevant than in diagnosing a patient with bipolar affective disorder, or manic-depressive illness (MDI). \n",
      "Perform a thorough clinical assessment for patients with a manic, hypomanic, or mixed episode, or those with a bipolar depression episode, including information about the patient’s clinical and psychosocial status, medical and psychiatric comorbidities, current and past medications as well as medication compliance, and substance use.[3] Obtain a detailed review of symptoms, symptom severity, and their effects on daily functioning in combination with the use of a standard tool.[3] \n",
      "The diagnosis of bipolar disorder type I (BPI) requires the presence of a manic episode of at least 1 week’s duration or that leads to hospitalization or other significant impairment in occupational or social functioning. The episode of mania cannot be caused by another medical illness or by substance abuse. These criteria are based on the specifications of the DSM-V.[2] The Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of Defense (VA/DOD) recommend using a standardized rating scale such as the Young Mania Rating Scale to assess the severity of a manic episode.[3] \n",
      "Manic episodes are feature at least 1 week of profound mood disturbance, characterized by elation, irritability, or expansiveness (referred to as gateway criteria). At least 3 of the following symptoms must also be present[2] : \n",

      "The mood disturbance is observable to others. The mood is not the result of substance abuse or a medical condition. The episode is not severe enough to cause social or occupational impairment. \n",
      "Major depressive episodes are characterized as, for the same 2 weeks, the person experiences 5 or more of the following symptoms, with at least 1 of the symptoms being either a depressed mood or characterized by a loss of pleasure or interest[2] : \n",
      "Depressed mood\n",

      "Symptoms cause significant impairment and distress and are not the result of substance abuse or a medical condition\n",
      "The mixed symptomatology is quite common in patients presenting with bipolar symptomatology. This often causes a diagnostic dilemma[62] and has prompted a revision to the definition of bipolar disorder in DSM-5. With the aim of capturing mixed symptoms more effectively, the “mixed episode” diagnosis has been eliminated in favor of a “mixed features specifier” that could be added to any mood bipolar disorder diagnosis.[63] Other specifiers include anxious distress, rapid cycling, mood-congruent psychotic features, catatonia, peripartum onset and seasonal pattern.\n",
      "Of interest, when investigating bipolar mixed states, Swann and colleagues concluded that although controversy exists regarding the definitions and properties of mixed states, the concept of mixed states and their characteristics over a range of clinical definitions and diagnostic methods has remained consistent.[64] Moreover, “distinct characteristics related to the course of illness emerge at relatively modest opposite polarity symptom levels in depressive or manic episodes.”[64] \n",
      "In addition to the well-known differences between manic and hypomanic episodes, other key differences exist between BPI and BPII that may be used to help distinguish between the 2 types of conditions. Data from 1429 bipolar patients included in the National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions showed significant differences between BPI and BPII patients in unemployment, a history of a suicide attempt, depressive symptoms (eg, weight gain, feelings of worthlessness), and the presence of specific phobias.[65] \n",
      "Use the Mental Status Examination (MSE) to aid in diagnosing bipolar affective disorder, or manic-depressive illness (MDI). This section highlights the major findings for a person with bipolar disorder to help support the diagnosis. Because the patient’s mental status depends on whether he or she is depressed, hypomanic, manic, or mixed, the following discussions of the various areas of the MSE include consideration of each of these particular phases. \n",
      "Persons experiencing a depressed episode may demonstrate poor to no eye contact. Their clothes may be unkempt, unclean, holed, unironed, and ill-fitting. If the person has lost significant weight, the garments may fit loosely. \n",
      "The personal hygiene of individuals experiencing a depressed episode reflects their low mood, as evidenced by poor grooming, lack of shaving, and lack of washing. In women, fingernails may show different layers of polish or one layer partially removed, and they may not have paid attention to their hair. Men may exhibit dirty fingernails and hands. When these individuals move, their depressed affect is demonstrated: They move slowly and very little; they show psychomotor retardation; they may talk in low tones or in a depressed or monotone voice. \n",
      "Persons experiencing a hypomanic episode are busy, active, and involved. They have energy and are always on the go. They are always planning and doing things. Others notice their energy levels and mood changes. \n",
      "In many ways, the behavior of a patient in the manic phase is the opposite of that of a person in the depressed phase. Patients experiencing the manic phase are hyperactive and might be hypervigilant. They are restless, energized, and active. They talk and act fast. Their attire also reflects the mania: Their clothes might have been put on in haste and are disorganized. Alternately, their garments are often too bright, colorful, or garish. These individuals stand out in a crowd, because their dress frequently attracts attention. \n",
      "In persons experiencing a depressed episode, sadness dominates the affect. These individuals feel sad, depressed, lost, vacant, and isolated. The \"2 Hs\"— h opeless and h elpless—often accompany their mood. When in the presence of such patients, one comes away feeling sad and down. \n",
      "In persons experiencing a hypomanic episode, the mood is up, expansive, and often irritable.\n",
      "In persons experiencing a manic episode, the mood is inappropriately joyous, elated, and jubilant. These individuals are euphoric. They also may demonstrate annoyance and irritability, especially if the mania has been present for a significant length of time. \n",
      "Persons experiencing a mixed episode exhibit both depression and mania within a brief period (≤1 wk).\n",
      "Patients experiencing a depressed episode have thoughts that reflect their sadness. They are preoccupied with negative ideas and nihilistic concerns, and they tend to \"see the glass as half empty.\" They are likely to focus on death and morbid persons, and many think about suicide. \n",
      "Patients experiencing a hypomanic episode are optimistic, forward thinking, and have a positive attitude.\n",
      "Patients experiencing a manic episode have very expansive and optimistic thinking. They may be excessively self-confident or grandiose, often have a very rapid production of ideas and thoughts, perceive their minds as being very active, and see themselves as being highly engaging and creative. These individuals are highly distractible and quickly shift from one person to another. \n",
      "Patients experiencing a mixed episode can oscillate dramatically between depression and euphoria, and they often demonstrate marked irritability. \n",
      "Two forms of a major depression are described, one with psychotic features and the other without. With psychosis, the patient experiences delusions and hallucinations that are either consistent or inconsistent with the mood. The patient’s delusions of having sinned are accompanied by guilt and remorse, or the patient feels he or she is utterly worthless and should live in total deprivation and degradation. Hence, the delusional content remains consistent with the depressed mood. Some patients experience delusions that are inconsistent with the depression, such as paranoia or persecutory delusions. \n",
      "By definition, patients experiencing a hypomanic episode do not experience hallucinations, although milder manic syndromes may be accompanied by such symptoms. \n",
      "Approximately three fourths of patients experiencing a manic episode have delusions. As in major depression, the delusional content is either consistent or inconsistent with the mania. Manic delusions reflect perceptions of power, prestige, position, self-worth, and glory. \n",
      "Patients experiencing a mixed episode might exhibit delusions and hallucinations consistent with either depression or mania or congruent to both. \n",
      "Patients experiencing a depressed episode have a very high rate of suicide. They are the individuals who attempt and succeed at killing themselves. Query patients to determine if they have any thoughts of hurting themselves (suicidal ideation) and any plans to do so. The more specific the plan, the higher the danger. \n",
      "Dubovsky has reported that the highest lifetime suicide risk (17.08%) is in men with bipolar disorder and deliberate self-harm.[66] Similarly, in a European study of adults with bipolar disorder, Bellivier and colleagues found that 29.9% had a history of at least 1 attempt of suicide (663 of 2219 patients who provided data on lifetime history of suicide attempts).[67] However, female sex, history of alcohol abuse, history of substance abuse, young age at first treatment for a mood episode, longer disease duration, greater depressive symptom severity (5-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale [HAMD-5] total score), current benzodiazepine use, higher overall symptom severity (Clinical Global Impression-Bipolar Disorder [CGI-BP] scale: mania and overall score), and poor compliance were the baseline factors associated with a history of suicidal behavior.[67] \n",
      "As patients emerge from a period of depression, their suicide risk may increase. This may be because, as the illness remits, executive functions are improved to the point where the person is again capable of making and carrying out a plan while the subjective feeling of depression and accompanying suicidal thoughts persist. \n",
      "Patients experiencing a hypomanic or manic episode have a low incidence of suicide. In mixed episodes, the depressed phases put the patient at risk for suicide. \n",
      "For more information, see the Medscape Reference article Suicide.\n",
      "In patients experiencing a depressed episode, suicide generally remains the paramount issue. However, certain persons in the depths of a depression see the world as hopeless and helpless not only for themselves but also for others. Frequently, that perspective can create and lead to a homicide followed by a suicide. \n",
      "For example, a 42-year-old mother of 2 was experiencing a significant depression as part of her bipolar disorder. She believed the earth was doomed and was a terrible place to dwell. Furthermore, she thought that if she died, her children would be left in a wretched place. Because of this view, she planned to kill her 2 children and then herself. Fortunately, her family recognized the state of affairs, which led to an emergency intervention and her hospitalization. \n",
      "Patients who are hypomanic frequently show evidence of irritability and aggressiveness. They can be pushy and impatient with others. \n",
      "Persons experiencing a manic episode can be openly combative and aggressive. They have no patience or tolerance for others, and they can be highly demanding, violently assertive, and highly irritable. The homicidal element is particularly likely to emerge if these individuals have a delusional content to their mania. These individuals act out of the grandiose belief that others must obey their commands, wishes, and directives. They may become violent toward those who do not comply with their demands. For example, a patient believing oneself to be a king will command others to fully, completely, and immediately follow his commands. The lack of compliance may make the patient violent.If the delusions become persecutory in nature, he may defend himself against others in a homicidal fashion. \n",
      "Persons experiencing a mixed episode may exhibit aggression, especially in the manic phases.\n",
      "Volavka reported that, relative to the general population, there has been a statistically significant increase in the risk of violence in individuals with schizophrenia and those with bipolar disorder.[68] Moreover, the evidence suggests that the risk of violence is greater in those with bipolar disorder (particularly during the manic phase) than in those with schizophrenia.[68] The risk of violence in both conditions is further increased by comorbid substance use disorder. \n",
      "In persons experiencing a depressive episode, the depression clouds and dims their judgment and colors their insights. They fail to make important plans/actions, because they are so down and preoccupied with their own plight. These individuals see no tomorrow; therefore, planning for it is difficult. Frequently, persons in the middle of a depression have done things such as forgetting to pay their income taxes. At that time, they have little insight into their behavior. Often, others have to persuade them to seek therapy because of their lack of insight. \n",
      "Persons experiencing a hypomanic episode generally act expansively and may demonstrate poor judgment by taking on too many tasks or becoming overinvolved. Often, their distractibility impairs their judgment, and they have little insight into their driven qualities. They see themselves as productive and conscientious, not as hypomanic. \n",
      "In patients experiencing a manic episode, judgment is seriously impaired. These persons make terrible decisions in their work and family. For example, they may invest the family fortune in very questionable programs, become professionally overinvolved in work activities or with coworkers, or start dramatically unsound fiscal or professional ventures. These individuals ignore feedback, suggestions, and advice from friends, family, and colleagues. They have no insight into the extreme nature of their demands, plans, and behavior. Often, commitment proves the only way to contain them. \n",
      "In persons experiencing a mixed episode, major shifts in affect during short lengths of time severely impair their judgment and interfere with their insight. \n",
      "Impairments in orientation and memory are seldom observed in patients with bipolar disorder unless they are very psychotic. They know the time and their location, and they recognize people. They can remember immediate, recent, and distant events. In some cases of hypomanic and even manic episodes, their ability to recall information can be extremely vivid and expanded. However, later in the course of their illness, their cognition becomes impaired. In extremes of depression and mania, these individuals may experience difficulty in concentrating and focusing. Similar to subcortical dementia, depression impairs cognition. \n",
      "Although the MSE has been used in this article to highlight key aspects of the examination, the clinician must pay particular attention to the patient’s physical health. As Fagiolini pointed out, patients with bipolar disorder have a high incidence of endocrine disorders, cardiovascular disorders, and obesity,[69] and these factors must be considered when medications are prescribed.[69, 70] \n",
      "The diagnosis of bipolar affective disorder, or manic-depressive illness (MDI), is based on the patient’s history and clinical course. \n",
      "Other conditions to be considered include the following:\n",
      "Epilepsy\n",
      "Fahr disease\n",
      "Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)\n",
      "Medications (eg, antidepressants can propel a patient into mania; other medications may include baclofen, bromide, bromocriptine, captopril, cimetidine, corticosteroids, cyclosporine, disulfiram, hydralazine, isoniazid, levodopa, methylphenidate, metrizamide, procarbazine, procyclidine) \n",

      "Oppositional defiant disorder (in children)\n",
      "Substance abuse disorders (eg, with alcohol, amphetamines, cocaine, hallucinogens, opiates)\n",
      "A number of reasons exist for obtaining selected laboratory studies in patients with bipolar affective disorder, or manic-depressive illness (MDI). An extensive range of tests is indicated, because bipolar disorder encompasses both depression and mania and because a significant number of medical causes for each state exists. The basic principle remains, \"Do not miss a treatable medical cause for the mental status.\" \n",
      "Second, the condition necessitates use of a number of medications that require certain body systems to be working properly. For example, lithium requires an intact genitourinary (GU) system and can affect certain other systems, and certain anticonvulsants can suppress bone marrow. \n",
      "Third, because bipolar illness is a lifelong disorder, performing certain baseline studies is important to establish any long-term effects of the medications. \n",
      "A number of infections, especially chronic infections, can produce a presentation of depression in the patient. An encephalitis can dramatically manifest as changes in mental status and, in rare situations, present with bipolar features. \n",
      "A complete blood count (CBC) with differential is used to rule out anemia as a cause of depression in bipolar affective disorder, or manic-depressive illness (MDI). Treatment, especially with certain anticonvulsants, may depress the bone marrow—hence the need to check the red blood cell (RBC) and white blood cell (WBC) counts for signs of bone marrow suppression. \n",
      "Lithium may cause a reversible increase in the WBC count.\n",
      "The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is determined to look for any underlying disease process such a lupus or an infection. An elevated ESR often indicates an underlying disease process. \n",
      "In some cases, a fasting glucose level is indicated to rule out diabetes. In addition, atypical antipsychotics have been associated with weight gain and problems with blood glucose regulation in patients with diabetes, therefore, a baseline fasting glucose should be obtained. \n",
      "Serum electrolyte concentrations are measured to help diagnose electrolyte problems, especially with sodium, that are related to depression. Treatment with lithium can lead to renal problems and electrolyte problems, and low sodium levels can lead to higher lithium levels and lithium toxicity. Hence, in screening candidates for lithium therapy as well as those on lithium therapy, checking electrolytes is indicated. \n",
      "Serum calcium is assessed to diagnose hypercalcemia and hypocalcemia associated with mental status changes (eg, hyperparathyroidism). An elevated calcium blood level can cause depression or mania. Hyperparathyroidism, as evidenced by an elevated calcium blood level, produces depression. Certain antidepressants, such as nortriptyline, affect the heart; therefore, checking calcium levels is important. \n",
      "Low serum protein levels found in patients who are depressed may be a result of not eating. Such low levels increase the availability of certain medications, because these drugs have less protein to which to bind. \n",
      "Thyroid tests are performed to rule out hyperthyroidism (mania) and hypothyroidism (depression). Treatment with lithium can cause hypothyroidism, and hypothyroidism may cause rapid cycling of mood, especially in women. \n",
      "In a study to assess the relationship between bipolar affective disorder and thyroid dysfunction, Krishna et al found that elevated T3 hormone had a statistically significantly association with bipolar disorder.[71] In fact, patients with bipolar disorder were 2.55 times more commonly associated with thyroid dysfunction than individuals without bipolar disorder.[71] \n",
      "Kidney failure can present as depression. Treatment with lithium can affect urinary clearances, and serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels can increase; however, other signs and symptoms of kidney failure will appear first. Carefully and regularly monitor renal function. \n",
      "Antipsychotics agents have also been associated with changes in patients’ lipid profiles, potentially resulting in dyslipidemia (eg, hypertriglyceridemia), as well as liver damage/dysfunction. \n",
      "Although not a routine screening test in bipolar disorder and unnecessary in patients with normal liver function test results, urine copper level testing may be performed to rule out Wilson disease, which produces mental changes. Wilson disease is a rare condition that is easily missed. \n",
      "Antinuclear antibody testing is used to rule out lupus.\n",
      "Testing for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) may be helpful. Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) causes changes in mental status, including dementia and depression. \n",
      "Obtaining a Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) test may be indicated in selected patients. Syphilis, especially in its later stage, alters mental status. \n",
      "Alcohol abuse and abuse of a wide variety of drugs can present as either mania or depression. For example, speed (ie, amphetamines) and cocaine abuse can present as a manialike disorder, and barbiturate abuse can present as a depressionlike disorder.\n",
      "A number of patients with bipolar affective disorder, or manic-depressive illness (MDI), also have a drug or alcohol addiction; that is, they have dual diagnoses. Indeed, relative to other mental illnesses, individuals with bipolar disorder have a disproportionately high rate of substance use disorders, a co-occurrence that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality.[72] \n",
      "Performing a substance screen helps to make this dual diagnosis. If the patient has a dual diagnosis, addiction-focused treatment should be coordinated with the treatment of bipolar disorder.[3] \n",
      "The total value of performing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in a patient with bipolar affective disorder, or manic-depressive illness (MDI), remains unclear; however, a couple of reasons do exist for performing an imaging study. Because manic-depressive illness is a lifelong disease, a strong battery of studies rules out any other medical etiology and establishes a baseline. Some investigators report that patients with mania demonstrate hyperintensity in their temporal lobes. \n",
      "Many of the antidepressants, especially the tricyclic agents and some of the antipsychotics, can affect the heart and cause conduction problems. Lithium also can lead to changes such as reversible flattening or inversion of T waves on electrocardiography (ECG). In older patients with bipolar affective disorder, or manic-depressive illness (MDI), on lithium or tricyclic antidepressant therapy, a pretreatment ECG is important. \n",
      "Generally, routine electroencephalography (EEG) is unnecessary in the evaluation of bipolar affective disorder, or manic-depressive illness (MDI). However, some reasons for ordering EEG in patients with bipolar illness may be appropriate and include the following: \n",
      "EEG provides a baseline and helps to rule out any neurologic problems; use this test to rule out a seizure disorder and brain tumor \n",
      "If electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is contemplated, an EEG may be helpful; EEG monitoring during ECT is used to determine the occurrence and duration of seizure \n",
      "Some studies have shown that abnormalities in EEG findings have been indicative of anticonvulsant effectiveness; specifically, an abnormal EEG finding may predict the response to valproate \n",
      "Some patients may have seizures when on medications, especially antidepressants; in addition, lithium can cause diffuse slowing throughout the brain \n",
      "Always evaluate patients with mania, hypomania, or mixed episode, and those with bipolar depression, for suicidality, acute or chronic psychosis, or other unstable or dangerous conditions.[3] \n",
      "The treatment of bipolar affective disorder, or manic-depressive illness (MDI), is directly related to the phase of the episode (ie, depression or mania) and the severity of that phase. For example, a person who is extremely depressed and exhibits suicidal behavior requires inpatient treatment. In contrast, an individual with a moderate depression who still can work would be treated as an outpatient. Fortunately, most patients recover from the first manic episode, but their course beyond that is variable.[73] \n",
      "It is important to determine whether current medications may be causing the patient’s manic, hypomanic, or mixed manic episode. In such patients, discontinue antidepressants or other mania-inducing agents. However, antidepressants known to have associated discontinuation syndromes should be tapered over several weeks.[3] \n",
      "Evaluate and closely monitor patients with bipolar depression for the risk for mood destabilization or switching to mania and for the presence of emergent symptoms following initiation of pharmacotherapy for a depressive episode.[3] Initiate an antipsychotic agent in patients with bipolar depression with psychotic features, and consider psychosocial interventions (eg, psychoeducation; psychotherapy strategies such as cognitive behavioral therapy [CBT], interpersonal and social rhythm therapy [IPSRT], family focused therapy; chronic care model-based interventions).\n",
      "The patient’s response to treatment may depend on the number of previous episodes of bipolar disorder. In a report that analyzed pooled data, the importance of early intervention was demonstrated with better treatment responses in individuals who had earlier stages of illness.[74] Bipolar patients who experienced fewer previous mania episodes (1-5) displayed a twofold increase in the treatment response rate to olanzapine relative to those who had already experienced more than 5 previous episodes.[74] In patients with depression, the response rates were also significantly higher in patients with fewer episodes, although the findings were only for 2 of the measured responses. In the maintenance studies, groups with fewer previous episodes (1-5 or 6-10) experienced a 40-60% reduction in the risk of relapse to either mania or depression compared to the group that had more than 10 previous episodes.[74] \n",
      "If the patient is in a short-term inpatient care unit and has not made significant progress, reevaluate the management strategy. Transfer to a long-term inpatient care unit might also be considered. If the patient is in a depressed or manic phase and is not responding to medications, transfer the patient to a facility where electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) can be administered. Additionally, consultation with a psychiatric colleague or a psychopharmacologist is always appropriate if the patient does not respond to conventional treatment and medication. \n",
      "All patients with bipolar disorder need outpatient monitoring for both medications and psychotherapy. In addition, these individuals need education regarding their condition. The schedule must be regular, with great flexibility if they need extra sessions.\n",
      "The 2010 Veterans Administration/Department of Defense (VA/DoD) clinical practice guideline for management of bipolar disorder recommends reassessing patients who start treatment for acute bipolar mania, hypomania, or mixed episodes every 1-2 weeks for at least 6 weeks.[3] Patients with severe mania who are not hospitalized should be reassessed every 2-5 days until symptoms improve. An absence of any significant symptoms of mania or depression for 2 months should be considered to be full remission and assessment of symptoms should then be continued periodically to monitor for relapse.[3] \n",
      "Evaluate the patient’s response to treatment with the same standardized tool at follow-up visits, after changes in therapy, and with periodic assessments until complete remission has been reached.[3] The Center for Quality Assessment and Improvement in Mental Health (CQAIMH) provides assessment and screening tools for bipolar disorder and suicide at: http://www.cqaimh.org/stable.html.\n",
      "No surgical care is indicated for bipolar disorder. Historically, treatment was attempted with psychosurgical procedures, such as prefrontal lobotomy. However, lobotomy is no longer used in the clinical care of patients with bipolar disorder.\n",
      "Patients diagnosed with bipolar mania or depression and severe symptoms must be referred for urgent/emergent mental health intervention.[3] The indications for inpatient treatment in a person with bipolar affective disorder, or manic-depressive illness (MDI), include the following: \n",
      "Danger to self\n",
      "Danger to others\n",
      "Delirium\n",
      "Marked psychotic symptoms\n",
      "Total inability to function\n",
      "Total loss of control (eg, excessive spending, undertaking a dangerous trip)\n",
      "Medical conditions that warrant medication monitoring (eg, substance withdrawal/intoxication)\n",
      "Patients with a possible diagnosis of bipolar depression must also be referred for urgent/emergent mental health intervention if they present with serious delusion, visual/auditory hallucinations, confusion, catatonic behavior, extreme negativism/mutism, and/or inappropriate affect of a bizarre or odd quality.[3] \n",
      "A patient with bipolar disorder, especially one in a depressive episode, may present with a significant risk for suicide, especially those with an early onset of symptoms.[75] Serious suicide attempts and specific ideation with plans constitute clear evidence of the need for constant observation and preventive protection; consider referring these individuals to mental health specialty care.[3] Occasionally, depression is so profound that the person cannot function at all; thus, the danger to the person may come from other aspects of the disease. For example, a person in extreme mania who foregoes sleep or food may be in a state of serious exhaustion. Leaving such a person alone would be dangerous and not therapeutic. \n",
      "Goldstein and associates followed the mental health of 413 youths diagnosed with bipolar disorders and found that 76 (18%) attempted suicide at least once within 5 years of study; of these youths, 31 (8% of the overall group and 41% of those who attempted suicide) made many attempts.[75] The investigators concluded that bipolar disorder with early onset is associated with high suicide attempt rates. Therefore, the patient’s severity of depression at presentation and their family history of depression must be considered when evaluating youths with bipolar disorder and their suicide risk.[75] \n",
      "Patients with bipolar disorder can also become a threat to others. For example, a patient experiencing a severe depression believed the world was so bleak that she planned to kill her children to spare them from the world’s misery. \n",
      "Sometimes, patient’s behaviors are totally out of control, which is a particular concern during a manic episode. In this situation, patients’ behaviors are so beyond limits that they destroy their career and can be harmful to those around them. For example, a delusional patient having a manic episode believed everyone was against him; he searched for a rifle in order to defend himself and to “get them” before they “got” him. \n",
      "Some patients with bipolar disorder have other medical conditions for which medication monitoring is warranted. For example, patients with certain cardiac conditions should be in a medical environment where the effects of the psychotropic medications can be monitored and observed closely. \n",
      "In the clearest case of the bipolar/depressed phase, the patient is suicidal and homicidal in a few situations (this can result in homicide followed by suicide). In these scenarios, institutioinal commitment is in order and indicated. In other situations, the depression has led to an inability of the patient to work, eat, and function; hospitalization is also indicated in these cases. \n",
      "In the situation of a patient in the bipolar/manic phase, although the patient does not show clear and dramatic evidence of homicide or suicide, a pattern of very poor judgment and impairment emerges. Because of their behavior during the manic phase, the person often does major damage to their finances, career, and position in the community. This type of self-destructive mania calls for containment with good documentation and family support. \n",
      "In general, patients with bipolar affective disorder, or manic-depressive illness (MDI), who are candidates for partial hospitalization or day treatment experience severe symptoms but have some level of control and a stable living environment. For example, a patient with severe depression who has thoughts of suicide but no plans to act upon them and who has a high degree of motivation can get well when given a great deal of interpersonal support, especially during the day, and with the help of a very involved and supportive family. The family needs to be home every night and should be very concerned with the patient’s care. \n",
      "Partial hospitalization also offers a bridge to return to work. Returning directly to work is often difficult for patients with severe symptoms, and partial hospitalization provides support and interpersonal relationships. \n",
      "Outpatient treatment for patients with bipolar affective disorder, or manic-depressive illness (MDI), has 4 major goals, as follows: \n",
      "Look at areas of stress and find ways to handle them: The stresses can stem from family or work, but if they accumulate, they propel the person into mania or depression; this is a form of psychotherapy \n",
      "Monitor and support the medication: Medications make an incredible difference, and the key is to obtain the benefits while avoiding adverse effects; patients are ambivalent about their medications—although they recognize that the drugs help and prevent hospitalizations, they also resent that they need them; the goal is to address their feelings and allow them to continue with the medications \n",
      "Develop and maintain the therapeutic alliance: This is one of the many reasons for the practitioner to deal with the patient’s ambivalence about the medications; over time, the strength of the alliance helps keep the patient’s symptoms at a minimum and helps the patient remain in the community \n",
      "Provide education (see Patient Education): The clinician must help educate both the patient and the family about bipolar illness; patients and families need to be aware of the dangers of substance abuse, the situations that would lead to relapse, and the essential role of medications; support groups for patients and families are of tremendous importance \n",
      "Psychotherapy helps patients with bipolar disorder but does not cure the disorder by itself. When Schottle and colleagues looked at psychotherapy for patients, family, and caregivers, they found that although results were heterogeneous, most studies demonstrated relevant positive results in regard to decreased relapse rates, improved quality of life, increased functioning, or more favorable symptom improvement.[4] \n",
      "Somatic health issues in individuals with bipolar disorder are ubiquitous, underrecognized, and suboptimally treated.[76] Therefore, practitioners must pay attention to patient’s medical conditions, including cardiovascular concerns, diabetes, endocrine problems, infections, urinary complications, and electrolyte imbalances. In view of the possible medical complications, medical follow-up is important. Persons with bipolar disorder often have difficulty obtaining primary physician care.[77] \n",
      "Patients with chronic medical illnesses and depression should be treated with a comprehensive approach involving the patient, the family, the support team, the physician, other professionals, and community resources. Such models, called Collaborative Chronic Care Models (CCMs), have been developed to improve outcomes in chronically ill patients treated in the primary care setting who also suffer from depression. CCMs were defined a priori as interventions with at least 3 of the 6 components of the Improving Chronic Illness Care initiative, as follows: \n",
      "Patient self-management support\n",
      "Clinical information systems\n",
      "Delivery system redesign\n",
      "Decision support\n",
      "Organizational support\n",
      "Community resource linkages\n",
      "When Woltmann et al examined this approach in patients with bipolar disorder, they concluded that CCMs can improve both mental and physical outcomes for patients with mental disorders across a wide range of care settings.[78] CCMs also provide a robust clinical and policy framework for the integration of care. The review included 78 articles, yielding 161 analyses from 57 trials.[78] \n",
      "Appropriate medication depends on the stage of the bipolar affective disorder, or manic-depressive illness (MDI), the patient is experiencing. Thus, a number of drugs are indicated for an acute manic episode, primarily the antipsychotic agents, valproate, and benzodiazepines (eg, lorazepam, clonazepam). The choice of agent depends on the presence of symptoms such as psychotic symptoms, agitation, aggression, and sleep disturbance. (See the list of medications for bipolar disorder in Table 1, below.) For patients with bipolar affective disorder in the depressed phase, the Medscape Reference article Depression provides antidepressant guidelines. \n",

      "Bauer and colleagues have suggested 2 approaches to treatment options in bipolar patients.[80] First, in a patient with bipolar depression who is not currently being treated with a mood-stabilizing agent (de novo depression, first or subsequent episode), options include quetiapine or olanzapine, with carbamazepine and lamotrigine as alternatives.[80] Antidepressants are options for short-term use, but it remains controversial as to whether it is better to administer them in combination with mood-stabilizing agents or as monotherapy. Second, if the patient is already optimally treated with a mood-stabilizing agent (appropriate dose, good compliance) such as lithium, an option would be lamotrigine. No evidence suggests additional benefit from antidepressants if a patient is already being treated with a mood stabilizer, but this often tried in practice.[80] \n",
      "One cautionary note of interest: Post and colleagues found that the more different antidepressant trials the patient with bipolar disorder has received, the less responsive they become to treatment.[81] \n",
      "Inhaled loxapine (Adasuve) is the first noninjectable therapy approved by the FDA to treat acute agitation associated with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder type I (BPI). The FDA approval was based on 2 phase III studies of 658 individuals; statistically significant reductions in agitation were apparent starting 10 minutes following administration compared with placebo, and these effects were sustained at 2 hours.[82, 83] \n",
      "Combined therapy with an antipsychotic agent and another antimanic medication is recommended for patients with severe mania or mixed episodes, with or without psychotic features.[3] Thus, lithium, a drug commonly used for prophylaxis and treatment of manic episodes, or valproate may be used in combination with antipsychotic agents (eg, severe mania: olanzapine, quetiapine, aripiprazole, risperidone, or possibly ziprasidone; severe mixed episode: aripiprazole, olanzapine, risperidone, haloperidol or possibly quetiapine or ziprasidone).[3] \n",
      "Despite the serious side effects associated with clozapine, the Veterans Administration/Department of Defense (VA/DoD) suggest this drug may be added to existing medications if it was successfully used previously for severe mania or mixed episodes or if other antipsychotic agents are unsuccessful.[3] \n",
      "Reevaluate nonhospitalized patients being treated for severe mania or mixed episodes every 2-5 days until symptomatic improvement, and adjust medication dosages and regimens as needed.[3] The therapeutic range of lithium is a serum trough concentration between 0.6-1.2 mEq/L; for valproate, 50-125 mcg/mL; and for carbamazepine, 4-12 mcg/mL. If the patient’s serum concentrations of their medication fall below the therapeutic range, adjust the drug’s dose to the maximum range. For medications without known therapeutic plasma concentrations, increase the dose until symptomatic improvement, patient intolerance, or the manufacturer’s maximum dose limits have been reached.[3] \n",
      "Initiate lithium, valproate, carbamazepine, aripiprazole, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidone, or ziprasidone in patients with mania.[3] In patients with mixed episodes, initiate therapy with valproate, carbamazepine, aripiprazole, olanzapine, risperidone, or ziprasidone. Consider clozapine, haloperidol, or oxcarbazepine in patients with mania or mixed episodes, and consider lithium or quetiapine in those with mixed episodes.[3] \n",
      "It is not recommended that topiramate, lamotrigine, and gabapentin be used to treat patients with mania or mixed episodes.[3] \n",
      "The American Psychiatric Association's (APA) 2005 guideline watch for the treatment of patients with bipolar disorder noted that medications having the strongest evidence for efficacy for the acute treatment of depression in BPI are the olanzapine-fluoxetine combination, quetiapine, and lamotrigine.[53] Furthermore, there is some evidence that pramipexole may be helpful as an adjunctive agent, although only modest evidence exists for the efficacy of an antidepressant with adjunctive mood stabilizer. Antidepressants in the absence of a mood stabilizer are not recommended by the APA for BPI patients.[53] \n",
      "\n",
      "Monotherapy\n",
      "\n",
      "The VA/DoD considers first-line monotherapy in adult patients with bipolar depression to include quetiapine, lamotrigine, or lithium.[3] Cautiously consider olanzapine monotherapy due to its adverse effects. Second-line pharmacotherapy includes the combination of olanzapine/fluoxetine owing to its side-effect profile of weight gain, diabetes risk, and hypertriglyceridemia.[3] \n",
      "Although the VA/DoD found insufficient evidence for or against the use of valproate, carbamazepine, topiramate, risperidone, ziprasidone, or clozapine for managing bipolar depression, it did advise against aripiprazole monotherapy in patients with acute bipolar depression, except in cases in which there was[3] : (1) a previous good response during depression without a switch to mania or (2) a history of treatment of refractory depression. \n",
      "\n",
      "Combination therapy\n",
      "\n",
      "In patients whose bipolar depression is unresponsive to monotherapy, consider the combination of lithium with lamotrigine.[3] Alternatively, consider short-term augmentation of antidepressant agents with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), bupropion, and monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI); patients using this treatment strategy must be closely monitored for triggering of manic symptoms.[3] \n",
      "As in severe mania or severe mixed episodes, consider adding clozapine for augmentation, and closely monitor the patient for metabolic or other adverse effects.[3] Because of the known complications involved with clozapine, it is recommended that a psychiatric consultation be initiated. \n",
      "The VA/DoD found insufficient evidence for or against the use of augmentation with aripiprazole, olanzapine, risperidone, haloperidol, oxcarbazepine, topiramate, ziprasidone, valproate, or carbamazepine in bipolar depression.[3] However, the VA/DoD advised against the use of gabapentin and tricyclic antidepressant agents (TCAs) for monotherapy or augmentation in patients with acute bipolar depression, except in cases in which there was[3] : (1) a previous good response during depression without a switch to mania or (2) a history of treatment of refractory depression. \n",
      "\n",
      "Dosing or medication adjustments\n",
      "\n",
      "Switch to another effective treatment for patient intolerance to side effects. For patients that switch into mania or hypomania or enter a mixed manic state, follow the recommendations discussed above in Mania/hypomania or mixed episodes. \n",
      "Reevaluate patients every 1-2 weeks for a minimum of 6 weeks. As noted earlier, the therapeutic range of lithium is a serum trough concentration between 0.6-1.2 mEq/L; for valproate, 50-125 mcg/mL; and for carbamazepine, 4-12 mcg/mL.[3] If the patient’s serum concentrations of their medication fall below the therapeutic range, adjust the drug’s dose to the maximum range. For medications without known therapeutic plasma concentrations, increase the dose until symptomatic improvement, patient intolerance, or the manufacturer’s maximum dose limits have been reached.[3] \n",
      "In patients with a partial treatment response (no response 2-4 weeks after initiation of an adequate medication dose), consider augmenting the medication with additional agents as discussed under Combination therapy,discontinuing the current drug (tapered withdrawal with monitoring for antidepressant syndrome and mood destabilization) and switching to another effective agent, or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) if multiple trials of switching medications/augmentation strategies have been unsuccessful.[3] \n",
      "A study by Bauer et al suggested that lithium may also have a neuroprotective role.[84] However, this agent is also associated with increased risk of reduced urinary concentrating ability, hypothyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, and weight gain. The consistent finding of a high prevalence of hyperparathyroidism should prompt physicians to check patient calcium concentrations before and during treatment. Lithium is not associated with a significant reduction in renal function in most patients, and the risk of end-stage renal failure is low.[85] \n",
      "Atypical antipsychotics are increasingly being used for the treatment of both acute mania and mood stabilization. The broad range of antidepressants and ECT are used for an acute depressive episode (ie, major depression). However, ECT may also be considered for patients with severe mania or treatment-resistant mania, those who prefer ECT, and pregnant women with severe mania.[3] Ansari and Osser developed a very useful algorithm for the Harvard South Shore Program to treat a bipolar patient in a depressed phase through “an organized, sequential, and evidence-supported approach.”[86] Finally, another set of medications is chosen for the maintenance and preventive phases of treatment. \n",
      "Diazgranados and colleagues reported that for patients with treatment-resistant bipolar depression, impressive and swift antidepressant effects occurred when a single intravenous (IV) dose of the N -methyl-D -aspartate (NMDA) antagonist ketamine was administered.[87] Increasingly, the role of glutamate in mood disorders is being researched, and experimental evidence shows that the NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine may be helpful in short-term treatment of depression, even in the context of bipolar disorder. However, it is important to note that the benefit of such treatment disappeared after 4 days. \n",
      "Although antidepressant medications are most often prescribed for patients with bipolar disorder who are experiencing an acute depression, a study found that antidepressants were not statistically superior to placebo or other current standard treatment for bipolar depression.[88] \n",
      "Clinical experiences have shown that patients with bipolar disorder have fewer episodes of mania and depression when treated with mood-stabilizing drugs.[89] These medications not only serve to stabilize the patient’s mood, as the name implies, they can also dampen extremes of mania or depression. Kessing et al found that, in general, lithium was superior to valproate.[90] \n",
      "Atypical antipsychotics (including ziprasidone, quetiapine, risperidone, aripiprazole, olanzapine, and asenapine) are also now frequently used to stabilize acute mania—or even to treat bipolar depression in some cases. \n",
      "In the treatment of depression associated with bipolar disorder type II, Swartz and associates reported that 95% of relevant trials were published later than 2005.[91] They noted compelling evidence for the efficacy of quetiapine and preliminary support for the efficacy of lithium, antidepressants, and pramipexole. However, mixed support was noted for lamotrigine.[91] \n",
      "The role of mood stabilizers and antipsychotic medications in maintaining patients with bipolar disorder is well documented,[92] as is the use of long-acting antipsychotics to help with the maintenance phase. The APA’s 2005 guideline watch for the treatment of patients with bipolar disorder considered both lamotrigine and lithium to have substantial utility in the maintenance treatment of patients with bipolar disorder.[53] \n",
      "Popovic et al suggested the use of a Polarity Index to guide the choice of maintenance therapy in bipolar patients.[93] Based on results from randomized, placebo-controlled trials, the investigators indicated that this index may provide a measure of the relative preventive antimanic versus antidepressive efficacy of drugs that are used to treat bipolar disorder.[93] They defined a Polarity Index value greater than 1.0 as having a relative greater antimanic prophylactic efficacy, whereas a value less than 1.0 would have a relative greater antidepressive efficacy. The following are this study’s polarity indices results for maintenance drugs in bipolar disorder[93] :\n",
      "Risperidone: 12.09\n",
      "Aripiprazole: 4.38\n",
      "Ziprasidone: 3.91\n",
      "Olanzapine: 2.98\n",
      "Lithium: 1.39\n",
      "Quetiapine: 1.14\n",
      "Lamotrigine: 0.40\n",
      "Note that Popovic et al indicated the respective polarity indices for valproate and oxcarbazepine were potentially unreliable owing to the failure of their maintenance trials.[93] \n",
      "There have been concerns that ziprasidone may have adverse effects on body weight, fasting lipids, and fasting glucose. When Pappadopulos et al looked at a comprehensive set of analyses of metabolic alternations in patients on this medication, they found no significant differences between the ziprasidone and placebo groups in levels of fasting triglycerides, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or glucose in the controlled studies.[94] \n",
      "According to a multiple treatments meta-analysis of treatments for acute mania, the most efficacious treatments are haloperidol, risperidone, and olanzapine, significantly outperforming primary mood stabilizers and other antipsychotic medications.[95] In several randomized, double-blind, controlled studies, olanzapine monotherapy was significantly more effective in treating manic or mixed episodes than haloperidol[96] or divalproex monotherapy.[97] The adjunctive use of olanzapine with divalproex or lithium,[98] or of risperidone with divalproex or lithium, was also significantly more effective than divalproex or lithium alone.[99, 100] \n",
      "As outlined in the APA’s 2002 clinical practice guideline,[101] benzodiazepines have sedative effects, which may make them useful adjunctive medications until antimanic medications take effect. Additionally, the guideline stated that manic symptoms may be treated with chlorpromazine, which was deemed superior to placebo in a randomized trial and was deemed comparable to lithium (for controlling manic and psychotic symptoms) in acute treatment comparison trials.\n",
      "Children and adolescents who have bipolar disorder are particularly challenging to treat, and their discussion is beyond the scope of this article (see the Medscape Reference article Pediatric Bipolar Affective Disorder). However, Hamrin and Iennaco developed guidelines and recommendations for medications and management approaches after an extensive literature review using research findings on medication effectiveness in this population.[102] \n",
      "There is evidence that risperidone may be the best first-line treatment for childhood mania, as shown in a randomized controlled trial with patients aged 6 to 15 years with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision, (DSM-IV-TR) diagnosis of BPI (manic or mixed phase).[103] Specifically, risperidone was significantly more effective than lithium or divalproex sodium for the initial treatment of childhood mania; however, use of risperidone had the potential for serious metabolic side effects.[103] \n",
      "In August 2010, the FDA announced that lamotrigine carries a risk of aseptic meningitis.[104] \n",
      "In a study that sought to evaluate the safety and tolerability of second-generation antipsychotic (SGA) polytherapy compared with monotherapy in patients with bipolar disorder receiving open naturalistic treatment in the 22-site Systematic Treatment Enhancement Program for Bipolar Disorder (STEP-BD), Brooks et al concluded that although polytherapy was fairly common in bipolar disorder, it was also associated with increased side effects (eg, dry mouth, sexual dysfunction, and constipation) and increased health service use (almost threefold) but not with improved clinical status or function.[105] Therefore, polytherapy in bipolar disorder may incur important disadvantages without clear benefit, warranting careful consideration before undertaking such interventions.[105] \n",
      "Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is useful in a number of instances in patients with bipolar affective disorder, or manic-depressive illness (MDI), such as the following[3] :\n",
      "When rapid, definitive medical/psychiatric treatment is needed\n",
      "When the risks of ECT are less than that of other treatments\n",
      "When the bipolar disorder is refractory to an adequate trial with other treatment strategies\n",
      "When the patient prefers this treatment modality\n",
      "Often, the severity of the patient’s symptoms, the lack of response to medications, or the presence of contraindications to certain medications necessitates the use of ECT. This treatment modality has proven to be highly effective in the treatment of acute mania.\n",
      "The 2010 Department of Veterans Affairs/Department of Defense (VA/DoD) clinical practice guideline for management of bipolar disorder indicates ECT is the primary therapy in bipolar disorder patients that present with psychotic symptoms, catatonia, severe suicidality, food refusal leading to nutritional compromise, or who have a history of previous positive response to ECT.[3] Indeed, in a review of 50 years’ experience with ECT for acute manic episodes, data from early literature revealed that 313 of 400 patients with acute mania who received ECT showed significant clinical improvement.[106] \n",
      "Unless the patient with bipolar affective disorder, or manic-depressive illness (MDI), is on monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), no special diet is required. Patients should be advised not to make significant changes in their salt intake, because increased salt intake may lead to reduced serum lithium levels and reduced efficacy, and reduced intake may lead to increased levels and toxicity. \n",
      "Although a meta-analysis by Starris et al found strong evidence that bipolar depressive symptoms may be improved by adjunctive use of omega-3, omega-3 does not improve bipolar mania.[107] \n",
      "Patients in the depressed phase are encouraged to exercise. These individuals should try to develop a regular daily schedule of major activities, especially times of going to bed and waking up. Propose a regular exercise schedule for all patients, especially those with bipolar disorder. Both the exercise and the regular schedule are keys to surviving this illness. However, increases in exercise level, with increased perspiration, can lead to increased serum lithium levels and lithium toxicity. \n",
      "The main complications of bipolar affective disorder, or manic-depressive illness (MDI), are suicide, homicide, and addictions.\n",
      "Previously or currently suicidal patients remain at risk for suicide. Patients emerging from a depression are thought to be at an increased risk for suicide. The risk of self-destructive behavior and death is lifelong. Hong et al’s study demonstrated a genetic link between bipolar disorder and suicidal behavior, especially in white individuals.[108] According to a more recent study, men with bipolar disorder are at higher risk for suicide.[109] \n",
      "The European Mania in Bipolar Longitudinal Evaluation of Medication (EMBLEM) study, a 2-year prospective, observational study, suggested the following characteristics found in patients with bipolar disorder who are suicidal may help identify subjects at risk for suicidal behavior[110] : \n",
      "Female sex\n",
      "A history of alcohol abuse\n",
      "A history of substance abuse\n",
      "Young age at first treatment for a mood episode\n",
      "Longer disease duration\n",
      "Greater depressive symptom severity (5-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale [HAMD-5] total score)\n",
      "Current benzodiazepine use\n",
      "Higher overall symptom severity (Clinical Global Impression-Bipolar Disorder [CGI-BP]: mania and overall score)\n",
      "Poor compliance\n",
      "Homicidal patients, often in the manic phase, can be very demanding and grandiose. In this context, they are angered if others do not immediately comply with their wishes, and they can turn dramatically violent. In addition, these individuals can become homicidal by acting on delusions. \n",
      "Individuals with bipolar disorder are at risk for an addiction. This creates the problem of a dual diagnosis and, therefore, complicates treatment. \n",
      "One area of major concern is the relationship between violent crime and bipolar disorder. This danger is particularly present and prominent with patients who have a substance abuse problem.[111] Although some persons with bipolar disorder may become violent, clinicians must be vigilant when treating patients with the dual diagnosis of substance abuse. \n",
      "Quality of life (QOL) has been an important way to look at the effects of mental illness. Bipolar disorder type I (BPI) results in diminished quality of life as measured by health utility and QOL and utility-based health-related quality of life. The QOL losses in patients with BPI were less than those in persons with schizophrenia. The patients with depression sustained the greatest loss in QOL.[112] \n",
      "In a study by Fiedorowicz et al, hypomania symptoms were frequently associated with progression to bipolar disorder, even when symptoms were low intensity; however, most patients did not have hypomania symptoms at baseline.[113] The study concluded that monitoring for progression to bipolar disorder is necessary in patients with long-term major depressive disorder. \n",
      "Some of the most challenging situations involve children and adolescents with severe emotional lability. Often, psychiatrists have applied the bipolar diagnosis to this group. Leibenluft reviewed this situation and concluded that children have increasingly been diagnosed with bipolar disorder.[114] In some cases, the criteria were clearly met, whereas other cases were less clear. \n",
      "Severe mood dysregulation is a syndrome formulated to describe the symptoms of children who do not clearly meet the criteria for bipolar disorder. Leibenluft’s findings revealed that nonepisodic irritability in youths is common and is associated with an elevated risk for anxiety and unipolar depressive disorders (not bipolar disorders) in adulthood. In fact, data suggest that children and adolescents with severe mood dysregulation have lower familiar rates of bipolar disorder than children and adolescents with bipolar disorder. \n",
      "Prevention is the key to the long-term treatment of bipolar affective disorders, , or manic-depressive illness (MDI), as follows:\n",
      "First, use medications such as lithium serve as mood stabilizers\n",
      "Second, psychoeducation is instituted for the patient and the patient’s family; it is critical that the patient and the patient’s family understand and recognize the importance of medication compliance and the early signs of mania and depression \n",
      "Regardless of the pharmacologic regimen chosen in individual patients with acute bipolar mania, hypomania, or mixed episodes, and those with bipolar depression, reevaluate for treatment response every 1-2 weeks for a minimum of 6 weeks.[3] Continue to monitor these individuals for the following situations[3] : \n",
      "Depressive symptoms (or changes in), suicidal/homicide ideation\n",
      "Neurovegetative symptoms\n",
      "New-onset/change in psychotic symptoms or manic/hypomanic symptoms\n",
      "Illicit substance use\n",
      "Medication side effects and compliance\n",
      "Medical stability\n",
      "Significant psychosocial changes\n",
      "Reevaluate all patients for treatment response at 4-8 weeks, after each change in treatment, and periodically until full remission is achieved.[3] Full remission is defined in patients with mania as the absence of significant mania symptoms for 2 months; in patients with mixed episode, it is the absence of significant mania or depression symptoms for 2 months; and in those with bipolar depression, it is the absence of significant depressive symptoms for 2 months.\n",
      "Treat adult patients who have had an acute manic episode for a minimum of 6 months after the initial episode is controlled; encourage these individuals—as well as those who have had more than 1 manic episode or with 1 manic and 1 depressive episode, or 3 or more depressive episodes—to continue on lifelong prophylactic pharmacotherapy.[3] Following full remission of the depressive episode, consider withdrawing antidepressant treatment after 4-6 months. Discontinuation should consist of a gradual taper over a minimum 2-4–week period, unless medically contraindicated.[3] \n",
      "Appropriate medication for managing bipolar affective disorder, or manic-depressive illness (MDI), depends on the stage the patient is experiencing. The choice of agent depends on the presence of symptoms such as psychotic symptoms, agitation, aggression, and sleep disturbance. Drug categories include mood stabilizers, anticonvulsants, and antipsychotics \n",
      "By binding to specific receptor sites, benzodiazepines appear to potentiate the effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and facilitate inhibitory GABA neurotransmission and the action of other inhibitory transmitters. \n",
      "Lorazepam is an anxiolytic hypnotic with an intermediate onset of effects and a relatively intermediate half-life. By increasing the action of GABA, which is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, it may depress all levels of the central nervous system (CNS), including the limbic and reticular formation. \n",
      "Clonazepam is a long-acting benzodiazepine that increases presynaptic GABA inhibition and reduces monosynaptic and polysynaptic reflexes. It suppresses muscle contractions by facilitating inhibitory GABA neurotransmission and other inhibitory transmitters. \n",
      "Lithium is the drug commonly used for prophylaxis and treatment of manic episodes. A 2012 study suggested that lithium may also have a neuroprotective role.[81] However, this agent is also associated with an increased risk of reduced urinary concentrating ability, hypothyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, and weight gain. The consistent finding of a high prevalence of hyperparathyroidism should prompt physicians to check patient calcium concentrations before and during treatment. \n",
      "Lithium is not associated with a significant reduction in renal function in most patients, and the risk of end-stage renal failure is low.[84] Lithium therapy may serve to protect and preserve the hippocampal volumes, in contrast to patients with major depression (ie, unipolar), who show diminished hippocampal volumes.[85] \n",
      "Furthermore, recognizing that patients with bipolar affective disorder are at risk for suicide, lithium may also have some anti-suicidal action. A report from Lewitka and Bauer suggest that lithium may be an option for patients with affective disorders who are at risk for suicide. However, they caution that lithium is still a medication that requires careful assessment and monitoring. Patient adherence is essential.[43] \n",
      "Lithium is considered a first-line agent for long-term prophylaxis in bipolar illness, especially for classic bipolar disorder with euphoric mania. It also can be used to treat acute mania, although it cannot be titrated up to an effective level as quickly as valproate can. Evidence suggests that lithium, unlike any other mood stabilizer, may have a specific antisuicide effect.\n",
      "Monitoring blood levels is critical with this medication. Serum levels should be determined twice weekly during the acute phase, and until the serum level and clinical condition of the patient has been stabilized.\n",
      "Anticonvulsants have been effective in preventing mood swings associated with bipolar disorder, especially in those patients known as rapid cyclers. For the depressed phase, mood stabilizers, such as lithium and lamotrigine, are preferred, because antidepressants may propel a patient into a manic episode or exacerbate irritability in mixed-symptom mania. Gabapentin, although not a mood stabilizer, also may have anxiolytic properties.The most widely used anticonvulsants have been carbamazepine, valproate, and lamotrigine. More recently, topiramate and oxcarbazepine also are being tried.\n",
      "Note that the Department of Veterans Affairs/Department of Defense (VA/DoD) do not recommend lamotrigine, topiramate, and gabapentin in patients with mania or mixed episodes.[3] \n",
      "Carbamazepine is effective in patients who have not had a clinical response to lithium therapy and who have rapid-cycling bipolar disorder. Its efficacy is not well established for long-term use; therefore, periodically reevaluate the long-term risks and benefits of carbamazepine for individual patients. This drug can also act to inhibit seizures induced through the kindling effect, which is thought to occur by way of repeated limbic stimulation. \n",
      "Valproate has proven effectiveness in treating and preventing mania. It is classified as a mood stabilizer and can be used alone or in combination with lithium. This agent is useful in treating patients with rapid-cycling bipolar disorders and has been used to treat aggressive or behavioral disorders. A combination of valproic acid and valproate has been effective in treating persons in manic phase, with a success rate of 49%. \n",
      "Lamotrigine is an anticonvulsant that appears to be effective in the treatment of the depressed phase in bipolar disorders. It is used for the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder to delay the time to occurrence of mood episodes (depression, mania, hypomania, mixed episodes) in adults treated for acute mood episodes with standard therapy. \n",
      "Topiramate has an off-label indication for the treatment of bipolar disease. In a small retrospective review, marked improvement occurred in 62% of patients when topiramate was added to their current regimen.[115] It is unclear if topiramate's efficacy occurs only as adjunctive treatment. More studies are needed to examine potential benefits of this drug in treating bipolar. Unlike conventional neuroleptics, topiramate is not associated with weight gain. \n",
      "Second-generation, or atypical, antipsychotics are increasingly being used for treatment of both acute mania and mood stabilization in patients with bipolar I disease. \n",
      "Asenapine is indicated as monotherapy for the acute treatment of manic or mixed episodes that are associated with bipolar I disorder. It is also indicated as adjunctive therapy with lithium or valproate for the acute treatment of manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disease. The efficacy of asenapine is thought to be mediated through a combination of antagonist activity at dopamine 2 and serotonin (5-HT2) receptors. \n",
      "Ziprasidone is approved for the treatment of acute or mixed episodes that are associated with bipolar disorder. It can be used as maintenance treatment or as an adjunct to lithium or valproate. \n",
      "Quetiapine is indicated for acute treatment of manic (immediate release and extended release [XR]) or mixed (XR) episodes that are associated with bipolar I disorder. It can be used as monotherapy or adjunctively with agents such as lithium or divalproex. \n",
      "Risperidone is indicated for short-term treatment of acute manic or mixed episodes that are associated with bipolar I disorder. It can be used alone or in combination with lithium or valproate. Risperidone can be used in adults and adolescents aged 10-17 years with bipolar I disorder. \n",
      "Aripiprazole is indicated for the acute and maintenance treatment of manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder. It can be used alone or in combination with lithium or valproate. \n",
      "Olanzapine is used for the acute and maintenance treatment of manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder. It can be used alone or in combination with lithium or valproate. Olanzapine can be used in adults and adolescents aged 13-17 years with bipolar I disorder. \n",
      "The drug combination includes olanzapine, a second-generation antipsychotic, and fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. This drug is indicated for the acute treatment of depressive episodes associated with bipolar I disorder in adults. The clinical effects of this agent have not been studied in patients younger than 18 years. \n",
      "Clozapine has an off-label indication for treatment of acute manic episodes associated with bipolar disorder and treatment of refractory bipolar mania. This agent demonstrates weak D2 receptor and D1 receptor blocking activity. Clozapine also acts as an antagonist at adrenergic, cholinergic, histaminergic, and serotonergic receptors. \n",
      "Paliperidone may be used for refractory, moderate to severe mania alone or in combination with lithium or valproate. This agent is typically reserved for patients who decline electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and who do not respond to medication combinations involving lithium or valproate plus aripiprazole, haloperidol, or another first-generation antipsychotic. \n",
      "First-generation antipsychotics, also known as conventional or typical antipsychotics, are efficacious for treating both psychotic and nonpsychotic manic and mixed episodes, as well as hypomania. These agents are strong dopamine D2 antagonists. However, each drug in this class has various effects on other receptors, such as 5-HT2 serotonin, alpha1, histaminic, and muscarinic receptors.\n",
      "The mechanism of action for loxapine is unknown, but it is theorized to antagonize central dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2a receptors. The inhaled dosage form is indicated for acute treatment of agitation associated with schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder in adults. \n",
      "Haloperidol is used for the acute treatment of mania or mixed episodes in patients with bipolar disorder. It can be used alone or in combination with lithium or valproate in an adult patient. Haloperidol blocks postsynaptic dopamine receptors (D2) in the mesolimbic system and increases dopamine turnover by blockade of the D2 somatodendritic autoreceptor \n",
      "Phenothiazine antipsychotics, which are classified as first-generation antipsychotics, are efficacious for treating both psychotic and nonpsychotic manic and mixed episodes, as well as hypomania.\n",
      "Chlorpromazine is used to treat manic and mixed episodes in patients with bipolar I disorder. It can be used alone or in combination with lithium or valproate. Chlorpromazine blocks postsynaptic dopamine receptors (D2) in the mesolimbic system and increases dopamine turnover by blockade of the D2 somatodendritic autoreceptor \n",
      "Dopamine agonists are non-ergot agents that bind to D2 and D3 dopamine receptors in the striatum and substantia nigra.\n",
      "Pramipexole is used as add-on therapy for patients whose condition is refractory to combination therapy and have bipolar depression. Pramipexole is a non-ergot, full dopamine agonist that binds to D2 and D3 dopamine receptors. \n",

      "Social anxiety disorder (social phobia) - A strong, persisting fear of an interpersonal situation in which embarrassment can occur\n",
      "Specific phobia - An overwhelming, persisting fear of an object or situation; it differs from other anxiety disorders in that the fear and anxiety is induced by the presence of the phobic situation or object \n",

The average individual with specific phobia fears 3 objects or situations, and approximately 75% of individuals with specific phobia fear more than 1 situation or object.

      "Although agoraphobia may be associated with panic disorder, it is diagnosed irrespective of the presence of panic disorder. In cases where the presentation meets the criteria for both panic disorder and agoraphobia, both diagnoses should be applied. \n",
      "Several biologic theories are postulated for the pathogenesis of phobic disorders, most focusing on the dysregulation of endogenous biogenic amines. Sympathetic nervous system activation is common in phobic disorders, resulting in elevations in heart rate and blood pressure, as well as symptoms such as tremor, palpitations, sweating, dyspnea, dizziness, and paresthesias.[2] \n",
      "Psychological theories range from explaining anxiety as a displacement of an intrapsychic conflict (psychodynamic models) to conditioning (learned) paradigms (cognitive-behavior models). Many of these theories capture portions of the disorder. \n",
      "A psychoanalyst would likely conceptualize social anxiety as a symptom of a deeper conflict—for instance, low self-esteem or unresolved conflicts with internal objects. The treatment uses exploration with the goal of understanding the underlying conflict. \n",
      "A behaviorist would see phobia as a learned, conditioned response resulting from a past association with a situation that had negative emotional valence at the time of association (eg, social situations are avoided because intense anxiety was originally experienced in that setting). Even if no danger is posed in most social encounters, an avoidance response has been linked to these situations. Treatment from this perspective aims to weaken and eventually separate the specific response from the stimulus. \n",
      "Genetic factors seem to play a role in both social anxiety disorder (social phobia) and specific phobia. On the basis of family and twin studies, the risks for specific phobia and social anxiety disorder appear to be moderately heritable.[3, 4, 5] \n",
      "Preliminary neuroimaging evidence indicates that while different patterns of brain activation might be associated with the different phobias,[6] there is an overall increased activation in the prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, insula, and amygdala in phobic patients exposed to phobia-related triggers compared with healthy controls.[7] \n",
      "Neurobiologic and psychological theories, as well as familial patterns, have contributed to understanding the underlying causes of phobic disorders. \n",
      "\n",
      "Social anxiety disorder (social phobia)\n",
      "\n",
      "Functional brain imaging studies of individuals engaged in public speaking suggest that patients with social anxiety disorder tend to overactivate a circuit involving the amygdala (related to face recognition and negative emotions) and the hippocampus; this may be the substrate for the exaggerated fear response.[8] At the same time, patients with social anxiety disorder show a relative increase in dorsolateral prefrontal and temporal activation, which may be the result of impaired ability to process (inhibit) the excessive fear response efficiently.[9] \n",
      "Positron emission tomography (PET) has shown lower serotonin (5-HT) 1A binding in the amygdala and mesiofrontal areas, and negative correlations between cortisol plasma levels and 5-HT1A binding in the amygdala, hippocampus, and retrosplenial cortex have been reported in patients with social anxiety disorder.[10, 11] \n",
      "A review of 48 neuroimaging articles involving social anxiety disorder concluded that increased activity in the limbic and paralimbic regions is the most consistent finding (across imaging techniques) in social anxiety disorder.[12] \n",
      "\n",
      "Specific phobia\n",
      "\n",
      "Phobic reactions may result from activation of object recognition and emotional processing areas occurring in conjunction with inhibition of the prefrontal areas that are responsible for cognitive control over emotion-triggering.[13] \n",
      "A PET study showed that the phobic response in spider phobia (SpP) and snake phobia (SnP) phobia increased regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in the right amygdala, the cerebellum, and the left visual cortex but reduced rCBF in the prefrontal, orbitofrontal, ventromedial, primary somatosensory cortex, as well as auditory cortices. A positive correlation between amygdala activation and the subjective fear response emphasizes the importance of amygdala in this fear-phobia circuit.[13] \n",
      "Partially distinct neurobiologic substrates have been suggested for different types of phobias. A functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study of patients with SpP and blood-injection-injury phobia (BiiP) reported similar activation in several common regions across the 2 groups (thalamus, cerebellum, and occipitotemporal regions) but also group-specific activation in the dorsal anterior cingulate gyrus and the anterior insula in patients with SpP.[14] \n",
      "Increased fMRI activation of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), insula, thalamus, and visual areas, as well as the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, has been reported in patients with SpP as compared with normal controls during an anticipatory task of phobia-relevant versus neutral stimulation.[15] \n",
      "Social anxiety disorder can be initiated by traumatic social experience (eg, embarrassment) or by social-skills deficits that produce recurring negative experiences. Hypersensitivity to rejection, perhaps related to serotonergic or dopaminergic dysfunction, is present. It is theorized that social anxiety disorder represents an interaction between biologic and genetic factors and environmental events. \n",
      "Specific phobia can be acquired through conditioning, modeling, or a traumatic experience; it may even have a genetic component (eg, blood-injury phobia). \n",
      "Agoraphobia may be the result of repeated and unexpected panic attacks, which, in turn, may be linked to cognitive distortions, conditioned responses, or abnormalities in noradrenergic, serotonergic, or gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)–related neurotransmission. \n",
      "A familial pattern has been reported for both social anxiety disorder and specific phobia. Generalized social anxiety disorder further increases the risk of familial transmission. With respect to specific phobia, first-degree relatives appear to have an increased risk for the subtype of the phobia rather than for the specific trigger. For example, a given family may exhibit an increased rate of animal phobias rather than share a phobia of a specific animal.[1] \n",
      "The 12-month prevalence rates for the United States are estimated as follows[16] : \n",
      "Social anxiety disorder (social phobia) - 7%\n",
      "Specific phobia - 7-9%\n",
      "Agoraphobia - 1.7%\n",
      "Social anxiety disorder appears to be less common in much of the world than it is in the United States, with 12-month prevalence estimates clustering in the range of 0.5-2.0%; median prevalence in Europe is 2.3%. Prevalence estimates for specific phobia in European countries are close to those in the United States (~6%) but are generally lower in Asian, African, and Latin American countries (2-4%).[17] \n",
      "In the United States, social anxiety disorder tends to start early in life, with 75% of the patients experiencing its onset between ages 8 and 15 years and a median age at onset of 13 years.[18] The 12-month prevalence estimates for social anxiety disorder in children and adolescents are comparable to those in adults.[16] Prevalence decreases with advancing age[19] ; the 12-month prevalence for older adults is in approximately 7%.[16, 20] \n",
      "In general, specific phobia appears earlier than either social anxiety disorder or agoraphobia does. Most such phobias develop during childhood and eventually disappear. The estimated prevalence of specific phobia is approximately 5% in younger children[21] and 16% in children aged 13-17 years.[16] The prevalence is lower (3-5%) in older individuals, possibly reflecting a decrease in severity to subclinical levels.[16] \n",
      "The 12-month prevalence of agoraphobia in adolescents and adults is approximately 1.7%.[16, 22] Agoraphobia may occur in childhood, but the incidence peaks in late adolescence and early adulthood.[23] The 12-month prevalence in individuals older than 65 years is 0.4%.[24] \n",
      "The phobic disorders appear to have a higher incidence among women. Higher rates of social anxiety disorder are found in females in the general population (with female-to-male ratios ranging from 1.5:1 to 2.2:1),[25] and the sex difference in prevalence is more pronounced in adolescents and young adults.[26] \n",
      "Females are more frequently affected by specific phobia than males, at a rate of approximately 2:1, though rates vary across different phobic stimuli. Animal, natural environment, and situational specific phobias are predominately experienced by females, whereas blood-injection-injury phobia is experienced equally by the 2 sexes.[6] \n",
      "Agoraphobia has a female-to-male ratio of 2-3:1.[27] \n",
      "The prevalence of social anxiety disorder in the United States is higher in American Indians and lower in persons of Asian, Latino, African American, and Afro-Caribbean descent as compared with non-Hispanic white individuals. Prevalence figures for specific phobia and agoraphobia appear not to vary substantially across cultural or racial groups.[17] \n",
      "Most patients respond to treatment, with good resolution of symptoms. Patients with specific phobia often regain the highest level of functioning, whereas those with agoraphobia or social anxiety disorders may have residual symptoms or run a greater risk of relapse even after successful treatment. In fact, patients with social anxiety disorders with extensive deficits in social skills may not respond well to treatment; in one study, social anxiety disorder had the smallest probability of recovery after 12 years of follow-up.[28] \n",
      "The prognosis is determined by several factors, including the following:\n",
      "Severity of diagnosis\n",
      "level of functioning before onset of symptoms\n",
      "Degree of motivation for treatment\n",
      "level of support (eg, from family, friends, work, or school)\n",
      "Ability to comply with medication regimens, psychotherapeutic regimens, or both\n",
      "Considerable evidence shows that social anxiety disorder results in significant functional impairment and decreased quality of life.[29, 30] Despite evidence of impairment, only a minority of individuals with specific phobia ever seek professional treatment. \n",
      "Phobias are highly comorbid, social anxiety disorder in particular. Most comorbid social anxiety disorders and specific phobias are temporally primary, whereas most comorbid agoraphobia is temporally secondary. Comorbid phobias are generally more severe than pure phobias. Social anxiety disorder is also frequently comorbid with major depressive disorder (MDD) and atypical depression, which results in increased disability.[30, 31] \n",
      "There has been some controversy regarding whether anxiety disorders in general and phobic disorders in particular are independently associated with suicidal ideation and suicide attempts (ie, after comorbid mental disorders are adjusted for). \n",
      "Current evidence suggests that even after adjustment for sociodemographic factors and other mental disorders, the baseline presence of any anxiety disorder—including agoraphobia, social anxiety disorder, and specific phobia—is significantly associated with suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. Additionally, the presence of any anxiety disorder(again, including any phobic disorder) in combination with a mood disorder appears to increase the likelihood of suicide attempts over what would be expected with a mood disorder alone.[32] \n",
      "Significant morbidity is also possible in terms of work and relationships, especially in social phobia and agoraphobia. Patients with severe agoraphobia may be housebound and therefore unable to seek out medical attention when needed. Patients with concomitant panic attacks are at higher risk for substance abuse and suicide. \n",
      "The treating physician should begin a process of education, not only for the patient but also for family and friends who may be confused about the diagnosis and the need for treatment. \n",
      "Commonplace abilities such as socializing at gatherings or riding in a small elevator are taken for granted by most people, but patients who experience phobias may have tremendous difficulty in these areas and can be greatly helped significantly by a caring support system. Family and friends can encourage patients to confront fears and help them when necessary (eg, with medication compliance); they can also assist by learning when to stay out of the way and allow patients to venture forth on their own. \n",

      "Inquire about the amount of caffeine intake (including coffee, caffeinated teas, or sodas). Considering the overall noradrenergic hyperdrive of this group of patients, even moderate amounts of coffee might exacerbate the anxiety response and symptoms. \n",
      "If social anxiety disorder (social phobia) is suspected, ask the patient about any difficulties in social situations, such as speaking in public, eating in a restaurant, or using public washrooms. Fear of scrutiny by others or of being embarrassed or humiliated is commonly described by people with this disorder. \n",
      "If a specific phobia is suspected, ask about irrational and out-of-proportion fear or avoidance of particular objects or situations (eg, animals, insects, blood, needles, flying, or heights). Assess intensity and course of fear. \n",
      "If agoraphobia is suspected, inquire about any intense anxiety and avoidance of the feared object/situation following exposure to specific situations such as heights, animals, small spaces, or storms. Other areas of inquiry should include fear of being trapped without escape (eg, being outside the home and alone, in a crowd of unfamiliar people, on a bridge, in a tunnel, or in a moving vehicle). \n",
      "Anxiety is the most common feature in phobic disorders. Manifestations include the following (all of which should be asked about and assessed): \n",

      "Because anxiety manifests with a number of physical symptoms, any patient who presents with a de novo complaint of physical symptoms suggestive of an anxiety disorder should undergo a physical examination to help rule out medical conditions that might present with anxietylike symptoms (see Differentials). If a patient presents for a repeat visit with similar complaints, after medical contributors have been ruled out, a careful mental status examination might be preferable to repeat physical examination and laboratory investigations. \n",
      "When considering anxiety as the primary suspect, the physician should always remember that over time, patients with anxiety are just as likely to develop medical conditions as other patients are. Accordingly, a diagnosis of anxiety, though changing the threshold for investigation of physical symptoms, should not keep the patient from receiving regular follow-up examinations as otherwise indicated. \n",
      "More than 75% of patients with blood-injection-injury type phobia report a history of fainting in situations where they are presented with a trigger. Initial increases in heart rate and blood pressure are followed by decreases in both parameters, resulting in fainting. This physiologic response differs from the typical response seen in other phobias, in which exposure is followed by increased heart rate and blood pressure.[1] \n",
      "The physician should assess the patient’s appearance, behavior, ability to cooperate with the examination, level of activity, speech, mood and affect, thought processes and content, insight, and judgment. \n",
      "In a situation where the patient is abruptly confronted with the object of his or her phobia, his or her mental status examination will be significant for an anxious affect, with a restricted range. Neurovegetative signs (eg, tremor or diaphoresis) may be present. The patient also reports feeling anxious (mood) and can clearly identify the reason for his/her anxiety (thought content). The thought content is significant for phobic ideation (unrealistic and out-of-proportion fears). \n",
      "Insight may be impaired, especially during exposure, but in most cases, insight is preserved. Although patients still report that they cannot control their feelings, they also acknowledge that the severity of their fears is not justified. \n",
      "At any other time, the mental status of a patient with phobic disorder is within normal limits, except for thought content positive for phobic ideation. These phobic ideas may remain undisclosed unless specific questions about phobias are asked. Phobic disorders themselves do not present with suicidal or homicidal ideation, but comorbid conditions commonly associated with them (eg, depression and other anxiety disorders) often do. If comorbid conditions exist, the suicidal and homicidal risk should also be specifically assessed. \n",
      "If left untreated, social anxiety disorder or agoraphobia can result in tremendous morbidity. The patient becomes restricted to the most familiar surroundings (eg, a house) or the most trusted people (eg, a family member or spouse), and his or her ability to work and relate to other people is substantially impaired. In addition, there is a considerable risk of substance abuse with this degree of isolation,[33] and social anxiety disorder has been associated with an increased risk of subsequent depression.[34] \n",
      "Specific phobia has been associated with increased risk for suicide attempts and possibly suicidal ideation.[32] Individuals with this disorder may also be limited by having to avoid buildings (in the case of acrophobia), elevators (in the case of claustrophobia), or even their own lawn (eg, for fear of snakes). As a general rule, less impairment is observed in specific phobia than in social anxiety disorder or agoraphobia. \n",
      "Anxiety secondary to medical conditions must be excluded. Many anxiety attack symptoms resemble those found in life-threatening medical disorders (eg, myocardial infarction), which must be ruled out first. \n",
      "Phobic disorders in general have a higher female preponderance, though a higher percentage of men tend to seek treatment for social anxiety disorder. Earlier median ages at illness onset are reported for specific phobia and social anxiety disorder than for agoraphobia.[35] Most specific phobias develop during childhood and eventually disappear.

      "Any patient who presents with a new complaint of physical symptoms suggesting an anxiety disorder should undergo a basic laboratory workup to help rule out medical conditions that might present with anxietylike symptoms, such as those in the differential diagnosis (see Differentials). \n",
      "To rule out anxiety secondary to medical conditions, the following laboratory tests may be helpful:\n",
      "Thyroid function tests - Hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism\n",
      "Fasting glucose - Hypoglycemia\n",
      "Calcium - Hyperparathyroidism\n",

      "Anxiety often is not a significantly pathologic condition but simply a physiologic reaction that can be expected to occur under stressful life circumstances. Most anxiety reactions do not result in dysfunction or disability and will remit spontaneously over time. In addition, high placebo response rates have been documented across a range of anxiety disorders.[37] Accordingly, when an anxiety disorder is mild (ie, not associated with disability), a wait-and-see, supportive type of intervention is recommended. \n",
      "Treatment of phobic disorders usually consists of pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, or some combination thereof.[38] As a general rule, a selected medication regimen should be continued for at least 6-12 months. If the symptoms have resolved and the patient is not experiencing excessive stress, the physician can gradually taper the patient off the medication. Psychotherapy usually helps make the transition away from medication more successful. \n",
      "At present, 3 drugs are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of social anxiety disorder, as follows: \n",
      "The selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) paroxetine and sertraline\n",
      "The selective serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) venlafaxine\n",
      "In addition, placebo-controlled, randomized controlled trials and systematic reviews show that social anxiety disorder responds to the following agents: \n",
      "The SSRIs escitalopram,[39, 40] fluoxetine, and fluvoxamine \n",
      "The monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) phenelzine\n",
      "The reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A (RIMA) moclobemide (not approved in the United States)[37] \n",
      "Overall, SSRIs appear to be more effective than MAOIs for the treatment of social anxiety disorder.[41] SSRIs and venlafaxine are generally considered first-line agents, whereas benzodiazepines, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and MAOIs are considered second-line agents.[42, 43] MAOIs and TCAs are not commonly used in this setting. Although both are effective, the former carry a risk of drug-to-drug and dietary interactions, and the latter have tolerability issues. \n",
      "Antihypertensive beta-blocker therapy can be used as an augmentation strategy. Propranolol may be useful for the circumscribed treatment of situational/performance anxiety on an as-needed basis.[44] \n",
      "Selected anticonvulsants (eg, gabapentin, pregabalin, valproic acid, topiramate, and tiagabine) have been shown to be effective for social anxiety disorder in mostly open-label, uncontrolled clinical trials.[43] The evidence regarding the serotonin 1 (5HT-1) agonist buspirone in this setting is conflicting.[43] A few other medications, including the second-generation antipsychotics levetiracetam and D-cycloserine, have been considered, but at present, the evidence is insufficient evidence to permit any clear recommendations.[42, 43] \n",
      "\n",
      "Acute treatment\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment of social anxiety disorder should be initiated with an SSRI, titrated to the minimum effective dosage. If the response is partial or nonexistent at 6 weeks, the dosage may be increased; this may be done every 2 weeks until the maximum dose is reached. \n",
      "Patients in whom SSRI therapy fails will sometimes respond to treatment with a high-potency benzodiazepine (eg, clonazepam), an alpha-2-delta calcium channel blocker (eg, gabapentin or pregabalin), the antiepileptic levetiracetam, or the antipsychotic olanzapine; they may also respond to combined SSRI-benzodiazepine therapy.[37, 44, 45] \n",
      "Buspirone, the beta-blocker atenolol, and the TCA imipramine are all of unproven efficacy in this setting.[37] \n",

      "Long-term treatment\n",
      "\n",
      "Long-term treatment data from double-blind, randomized controlled trials addressing social anxiety disorder show that continuing SSRI or venlafaxine therapy for up to 6 months can result in increased treatment response rates.[37] Long-term treatment data on clonazepam are limited but support the long-term efficacy of this drug.[37, 44, 46] \n",
      "Beta-blockers, clonidine, and buspirone usually are not helpful for long-term treatment of social anxiety disorder. After 6-12 months of full response, slow tapering of pharmacotherapy should be considered. If symptoms recur after tapering, therapy should be restarted and continued indefinitely.[46] \n",
      "To date, no controlled studies have demonstrated the efficacy of psychopharmacologic intervention for specific phobias. Clinical lore suggests that as-needed administration of a short-acting benzodiazepine might be useful for temporary anxiety relief in specific situations (eg, right before boarding a plane, for patients with a fear of flying). \n",
      "Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials have shown that agoraphobia, specifically the panic symptoms, responds to treatment with SSRIs (eg, escitalopram, citalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, and sertraline),[47, 48, 49] venlafaxine and reboxetine, some TCAs (eg, clomipramine and imipramine), and some benzodiazepines (eg, alprazolam, lorazepam, diazepam, and clonazepam).[37] Data from comparator-controlled trials suggest that mirtazapine and moclobemide are reasonable alternatives.[37] \n",
      "\n",
      "Acute treatment\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment for agoraphobia should be started with an SSRI at a low dosage, which is then titrated to the minimum dosage that effectively controls the patient’s panic. Benzodiazepines can be used either as an adjunct or as primary treatment; however, they are usually not chosen as first-line therapy because of the potential for abuse.[50] If the patient has frequent panic attacks and no history of substance abuse, a benzodiazepine may be considered until the SSRI takes effect. \n",
      "If the response is minimal or nonexistent after 6 weeks, the SSRI dosage may be further increased every 2 weeks until a response is achieved or the maximal dosage reached. If the response is partial or absent at the highest SSRI dosage, the following alternatives should be considered: \n",
      "Switch to a different SSRI\n",
      "Switch to an agent from a different drug class (eg, venlafaxine, reboxetine, or a TCA\n",
      "Long-acting benzodiazepines (eg, diazepam and clonazepam) prescribed on a standing rather than an as-needed basis are preferred because of the reduced addictive potential; the dosage can be increased every 2-3 days until either the panic symptoms are controlled or the maximum dosage is reached. The short-acting agent alprazolam may be considered for short-term use to control acute symptoms of panic. \n",
      "Agents with unproven efficacy in this setting include buspirone, propranolol, antihistaminic drugs, and antipsychotic agents.[37] \n",
      "\n",
      "Long-term treatment\n",
      "\n",
      "Double-blind studies show that continuing an SSRI or clomipramine from 12 to 52 weeks results in increased treatment response rates.[37] For a patient with good response, treatment should be continued for 9-12 months before slow tapering of the medications is considered. If symptoms recur after tapering, treatment should be resumed and continued indefinitely. \n",
      "Suicide risk must always be considered, particularly in the treatment of a child or adolescent with a mood disorder. Physicians are advised to be aware of the following information and use appropriate caution when considering treatment with SSRIs in the pediatric and geriatric populations. \n",
      "In October 2003, the FDA issued a public health advisory regarding reports of suicidality in pediatric patients being treated with antidepressant medications for major depressive disorder. This advisory reported suicidality (both ideation and attempts) in clinical trials of various antidepressant drugs in pediatric patients. The FDA asked that additional studies be performed, because suicidality occurred in both treated and untreated patients with major depression and thus could not be definitively linked to drug treatment. \n",
      "In December 2003, the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) issued an advisory stating that most SSRIs are not suitable for use by persons younger than 18 years for treatment of “depressive illness.” After review, the MHRA decided that the risks that SSRI therapy posed to pediatric patients outweighed the benefits, except in the case of fluoxetine, which appeared to have a positive risk-benefit ratio in the treatment of depressive illness in patients younger than 18 years. \n",
      "Controlled studies have found behavioral therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to be effective in treating phobic disorders.[51] Computerized CBT (FearFighter) has been recommended for panic and phobia by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence guidelines (NICE).[52] \n",
      "Psychodynamic therapy (or insight-oriented therapy) is rarely indicated as an exclusive treatment for phobias and is now mostly reserved for cases of phobic disorders that overlap personality disorders. Deciding which treatment or combination of treatments to prescribe depends on a careful interview and assessment of the patient’s goals and level of pathology. \n",
      "For treatment of social anxiety disorder, self-exposure monotherapy has been shown to work as well as computer-based exposure training, clinician-led exposure, or combination therapies of self-exposure and CBT/self-help manual.[53] In a small, 12-week randomized trial, school-based training combining exposure therapy and social skills training was highly effective for adolescents aged 14-16 years with social anxiety disorder.[54, 55] \n",
      "A CBT-based approach, including gradual desensitization, is the most commonly used treatment for specific phobia. Other treatments include relaxation and breathing control techniques. \n",
      "Randomized controlled clinical trials indicate that specific phobias respond to exposure therapy.[56] A small, randomized controlled clinical trial showed that virtual reality exposure therapy is as effective as standard exposure for treating fear of flying, with gains maintained for up to 1 year after treatment.[57] \n",
      "In one study, after the successful completion of a 4-session CBT course, patients with specific phobias no longer showed significant functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activation in the prefrontal or parahippocampal areas[58] ; this finding supports the view that effective psychotherapy can normalize dysfunction in the neurocircuitry associated with anxiety and phobias. \n",
      "In another study, a single 4-hour CBT session, combined in vivo exposure, and modeling resulted in increased/improved medial orbitofrontal cortex activity and decreased/improved activation in the amygdala and the insula patients with specific phobias as compared with untreated control subjects.[59] \n",
      "A 2010 meta-analysis showed that a combination of exposure therapy, relaxation, and breathing retraining worked better than other psychological interventions for panic disorder with and without agoraphobia.[60] Furthermore, the inclusion of homework and a follow-up program have been shown to improve outcomes. Early intervention is recommended on the grounds that the shorter the duration of illness is, the better the response will be.[60] \n",
      "The patient’s intake of caffeine (eg, in coffee, caffeinated teas, or sodas) should be assessed; even moderate amounts of caffeine may exacerbate the anxiety response and symptoms. In a small, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, a tryptophan-rich diet was shown to have a positive effect on social anxiety disorder.[61] Dietary restrictions (a tyramine-free diet) are necessary for patients taking MAOIs. \n",
      "Activity should not be restricted. Patients should be encouraged to confront anxiety-producing stimuli in the context of a behavioral therapy treatment plan. \n",
      "Overwhelming exposure in early childhood (eg, a frightening experience with an aggressive dog) may predispose the child to the development of phobic symptoms. Intervention (eg, psychotherapy or medication) in the early stages of symptom development may be beneficial in preventing the worsening of symptoms. \n",
      "Physicians without expertise in conducting behavioral therapy may want to consult with a psychiatric center specializing in treatment of anxiety disorders, either for guidance on developing a treatment plan or, in more difficult cases, for referral. \n",
      "Consultation with an internist or a neurologist may be helpful for sorting through the nonpsychiatric differential diagnosis, especially if rare disorders, such as pheochromocytoma, are suspected (see Differentials). \n",
      "Inpatient treatment is indicated only for patients with a severe phobic disorder who presenting with acute suicidal ideation or attempts. In addition, inpatient treatment (including detoxification, rehabilitation, or both) may be recommended for treatment of secondary drug or alcohol abuse or dependence. \n",
      "Outpatient follow-up is usually required until the patient’s symptoms have resolved. After the resolution of the symptoms, the physician can attempt to taper pharmacotherapy, as well as monitor for relapse. \n",
      "Pharmacotherapy for phobic disorders (ie, social anxiety disorder, specific phobia, and agoraphobia) includes antidepressant agents (eg, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs] and selective serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors [SNRIs]), benzodiazepines, serotonin (5HT) 1 agonists, antihypertensive agents, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). \n",
      "SSRIs can help prevent panic attacks and alleviate symptoms of anxiety and depression. These drugs may require 2-6 weeks of daily use to become effective, usually with side effects appearing first. SSRIs have been shown to be effective in controlled clinical trials, and as a class, these medications tend to have the fewest adverse effects. However, the SSRIs can produce drug-drug interactions by inhibiting cytochrome P450 enzymes and by displacing other drugs from protein-binding sites.\n",
      "SSRIs are greatly preferred to other classes of antidepressants for the treatment of anxiety disorders, and they all appear to be similarly efficacious. The choice of an SSRI depends on adverse effects, drug interactions, and history of previous response.\n",
      "The relatively benign adverse effect profile of SSRIs (including minimal anticholinergic effects) facilitates compliance. Common adverse effects include insomnia, ejaculation disorder (primarily ejaculatory delay), nausea, sweating, fatigue, somnolence, and sexual dysfunction. SSRIs do not carry the cardiac arrhythmia risk associated with TCAs.\n",
      "Citalopram enhances serotonin activity through selective reuptake inhibition at the neuronal membrane. This agent is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of anxiety disorders, but data from randomized, controlled trials support its use for treatment of agoraphobia. \n",
      "Escitalopram is an S-enantiomer of citalopram. The onset of depression relief may be obtained after 1-2 weeks, which is sooner than relief can be obtained with other antidepressants, suggesting that escitalopram may work faster than similar drugs.\n",
      "Although this agent is not approved by the FDA for treatment of phobic disorders, its class membership and good tolerability make it an attractive option for long-term treatment. Off-label use of escitalopram for anxiety disorders includes social anxiety disorder (social phobia), panic disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Escitalopram is not approved for use in children younger than 12 years. \n",
      "Paroxetine is a potent selective inhibitor of neuronal serotonin reuptake, but it has a weak effect on norepinephrine and dopamine neuronal reuptake. This agent is a low-affinity antagonist at some subtypes of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors and is a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor. The anticholinergic effects of paroxetine may result in sedation or cardiovascular effects.\n",
      "Paroxetine is FDA-approved for use in social anxiety disorder (social phobia), panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, OCD, major depressive disorder (MDD), premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). \n",
      "Sertraline selectively inhibits presynaptic serotonin reuptake and is a low-potency dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. It is-FDA approved for use in social anxiety disorder; panic disorder; major depressive disorder; OCD in adults, children, and adolescents; PMDD; and PTSD. \n",
      "Fluoxetine selectively inhibits presynaptic serotonin reuptake but has minimal or no effect on reuptake of norepinephrine or dopamine. A common side effect is sexual dysfunction, which may impact long-term compliance. Fluoxetine is FDA-approved for use in panic disorder (with and without agoraphobia) and OCD, as well as other disorders. \n",
      "Fluvoxamine enhances serotonin activity through selective reuptake inhibition at the neuronal membrane. Because this drug does not significantly bind to alpha-adrenergic, histamine, or cholinergic receptors, it has fewer side effects than TCAs do. Fluvoxamine is FDA-approved for treating OCD in children (8-17 years) and adults; it is also approved for treating social anxiety disorder. Fluvoxamine may be helpful for other anxiety disorders as well. \n",
      "SNRIs can help prevent panic attacks and alleviate symptoms of anxiety and depression.\n",
      "Venlafaxine is a reuptake inhibitor of both serotonin and norepinephrine. It is FDA-approved (in the extended-release capsule only) for the treatment of social phobia, panic disorder with or without agoraphobia, and generalized anxiety disorder. \n",
      "In general, this category of medication should not be prescribed to patients with a history of alcohol/drug abuse or emotional dependence. Some psychiatrists feel that the longer-acting benzodiazepines (eg, diazepam, clonazepam) have advantages such as less frequent dosing and more consistent levels throughout the day. Slowly taper benzodiazepines (usually after 6 mo) to avoid withdrawal and to avoid precipitating panic. \n",
      "Alprazolam is the best-studied benzodiazepine. It has a rapid onset (20 minutes) and a short half-life, which can contribute to increased dependency during tapering attempts. Alprazolam is FDA approved for use in panic disorder, with or without agoraphobia, generalized anxiety disorder, and anxiety disorders (in the immediate-release tablet). \n",
      "Lorazepam is a sedative hypnotic with a short onset of effects and a relatively long half-life. By increasing the action of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA), which is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, lorazepam may depress all levels of the central nervous system (CNS), including the limbic and reticular formation. This agent is FDA-approved for use in anxiety disorders.\n",
      "When a patient must be sedated for longer than 24 hours, lorazepam is an excellent choice. It is not significantly metabolized by the liver, and it can be administered either intravenously (IV) or intramuscularly (IM). \n",
      "Clonazepam is a long-acting benzodiazepine that increases presynaptic GABA inhibition and reduces monosynaptic and polysynaptic reflexes. This drug also suppresses muscle contractions by facilitating inhibitory GABA neurotransmission and other inhibitory transmitters. Clonazepam reaches peak plasma concentration at 2-4 hours after oral or rectal administration.\n",
      "Clonazepam has multiple indications, including suppression of myoclonic, akinetic, or petit mal seizure activity and focal or generalized dystonias (eg, tardive dystonia). This agent is FDA-approved for use in anxiety disorders. \n",
      "Diazepam modulates the postsynaptic effects of GABA-A transmission, thereby bringing about an increase in presynaptic inhibition. This agent appears to act on part of the limbic system, the thalamus, and hypothalamus to induce a calming effect and has also been found to be an effective adjunct for the relief of skeletal muscle spasm caused by upper motor neuron disorders. This agent is FDA-approved for use in anxiety disorders.\n",
      "Diazepam is rapidly distributed to other body fat stores. To avoid adverse effects, the diazepam dosage should be individualized and increased cautiously; the serum concentration of the drug drops to 20% of its peak value 20 minutes after the initial IV infusion. \n",
      "Serotonin agonists such as buspirone may be used to treat anxiety.\n",
      "Buspirone is an antianxiety agent that is not chemically or pharmacologically related to the benzodiazepines, barbiturates, or other sedative or anxiolytic drugs. Rather, it is a 5-HT1 agonist with serotonergic neurotransmission and some dopaminergic effects in the CNS. Buspirone has an anxiolytic effect but may take up to 2-3 weeks to reach its full efficacy. Buspirone is approved for the treatment of anxiety disorders or short-term relief of the symptoms of anxiety. \n",
      "Antihypertensive agents are useful for the circumscribed treatment of situational/performance anxiety on an as-needed basis.\n",
      "Beta-adrenergic blockers reduce the inotropic state of the left ventricle (LV), decrease diastolic dysfunction, and increase LV compliance, thereby reducing the pressure gradient across the LV outflow tract. Decreasing myocardial oxygen consumption reduces myocardial ischemia potential, and lowering the heart rate reduces myocardial oxygen consumption and myocardial ischemia potential.\n",
      "Atenolol acts by selectively blocking beta1 receptors, with little or no effect on beta2 receptors. Beta-blockers affect blood pressure via multiple mechanisms, including a negative chronotropic effect that decreases heart rate at rest and after exercise, a negative inotropic effect that decreases cardiac output, reduction of sympathetic outflow from the CNS, and suppression of renin release from the kidneys.\n",
      "Atenolol is used to improve and preserve hemodynamic status by acting on myocardial contractility, reducing congestion, and decreasing myocardial energy expenditure. During IV administration, the patient's blood pressure, heart rate, and electrocardiogram (ECG) must be carefully monitored. \n",
      "Propranolol is recommended for situational social anxiety (stage fright) on an as-needed basis. An oral (PO) dose of 10-20 mg is given \n",
      "The tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) clomipramine and imipramine have demonstrated efficacy for the treatment of panic disorder with and without agoraphobia. These are also relatively inexpensive medications. However, due to their broad spectrum of action and their inhibition of multiple neurotransmitter systems, the TCAs have more side effects, such as anticholinergic and cardiovascular side effects, and therefore, these agents present problems for long-term treatment. The treatment response of TCAs occurs on the same order as the Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), within 2-6 weeks. \n",
      "TCAs have a black box warning that states that patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), both adult and pediatric, may experience worsening of their depression and/or the emergence of suicidal ideation and behavior (suicidality) or unusual changes in behavior, whether or not they are taking antidepressant medications. \n",
      "Clomipramine is a dibenzazepine compound that belongs to the TCA family. It acts by inhibiting the membrane pump mechanism responsible for norepinephrine and serotonin uptake in adrenergic and serotonergic neurons. Clomipramine affects serotonin uptake; it also affects norepinephrine uptake when converted into its metabolite desmethylclomipramine. Clomipramine acts as an antagonist at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors and is also an antagonist at histamine H1 receptors.\n",
      "Clomipramine is approved by the FDA for use in the treatment of OCD (adult and pediatric, age ≥10 years). \n",
      "Imipramine hydrochloride inhibits reuptake of norepinephrine or serotonin at the presynaptic neuron. This agent is an antagonist at histamine H1 and alpha1 adrenoceptors, as well as at M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. Parenteral administration can be used for starting therapy only in patients unable or unwilling to use oral medication. \n",
      "MAOIs are most commonly prescribed for patients with social anxiety disorder (social phobia). Their main advantages are a low risk of dependence and a lesser anticholinergic effect than is seen with TCAs. Their main disadvantage is the higher number of adverse effects, including sexual difficulty, hypotension, and weight gain. A diet low in tyramine must be followed to avoid a hypertensive crisis. Use concomitant medications, including over-the-counter medications, with great caution. Because of the high risk for serotonin syndrome or hypertensive crisis, MAOIs are contraindicated in patients taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors; dual serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors; tricyclic antidepressants; bupropion (Wellbutrin); mirtazapine (Remeron); buspirone (Buspar); and certain analgesics, vasoconstrictors, sympathomimetics, and anticonvulsants. \n",
      "Phenelzine is the most commonly used MAOI for anxiety disorders. (Tranylcypromine 30-60 mg/day is also effective.) Phenelzine is usually reserved for patients who cannot tolerate or do not respond to TCAs or SSRIs. \n",
      "Selegiline is a selective MAO-B inhibitor at lower therapeutic doses. As such, at the target dose of 6 mg per 24 hours, special dietary restrictions are not needed. In addition, the selegiline transdermal patch has the advantage of avoiding the first pass effect, which decreases the impact of CYP high/low-metabolizer status in terms of medication effects and tolerability. \n",
      "Selected anticonvulsants have been shown to be effective for social anxiety disorder in mostly open-label, uncontrolled clinical trials and may also be useful in the treatment of other phobic disorders. \n",
      "Gabapentin is a membrane stabilizer and a structural analogue of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which, paradoxically, is thought not to exert effects on GABA receptors. It appears to exert action via the alpha-2-delta1 and alpha-2-delta2 auxiliary subunits of voltage-gated calcium channels and has apparent anxiolytic properties.\n",
      "Pregabalin is a structural derivative of GABA. Its mechanism of action is unknown. It binds with high affinity to alpha-2-delta calcium channel subunits. In vitro, it reduces the calcium-dependent release of several neurotransmitters, possibly by modulating calcium channel function.\n",
      "The mechanism of action of valproic acid is not established; its activity may be related to increased brain levels of GABA or enhanced GABA action. Valproic acid may also potentiate postsynaptic GABA responses, affect the potassium channel, or exert a direct membrane-stabilizing effect.\n",

      "Benign positional vertigo (BPV) is the most common cause of vertigo. Vertigo is an illusion of motion (an illusion is a misperception of a real stimulus) and represents a disorder of the vestibular proprioceptive system. \n",
      "BPV was first described by Adler in 1897 and then by Bárány in 1922; however, Dix and Hallpike did not coin the term benign paroxysmal positional vertigo until 1952. This terminology defined the characteristics of the vertigo and introduced the classic provocative diagnostic test that is still used today. Using positional testing, benign positional vertigo can readily be diagnosed in the emergency department. Benign positional vertigo is one of the few neurologic entities the emergency physician can cure at the patient's bedside by performing a series of simple and safe head-hanging maneuvers.\n",
      "For further information, see Benign Positional Vertigo in the Neurology volume. \n",
      "Benign positional vertigo (BPV) is caused by calcium carbonate particles called otoliths (or otoconia) that are inappropriately displaced into the semicircular canals of the vestibular labyrinth of the inner ear. These otoliths are normally attached to hair cells on a membrane inside the utricle and saccule. Because the otoliths are denser than the surrounding endolymph, changes in vertical head movement causes the otoliths to tilt the hair cells, which sends a signal to the brain letting the brain know that the head is tilting up or down. \n",
      "The utricle is connected to the 3 semicircular canals. The otoliths may become displaced from the utricle by aging, head trauma, or labyrinthine disease. When this occurs, the otoliths have the potential to enter the semicircular canals. When they do, they usually enter the posterior semicircular canal because this is the most dependent (inferior) of the 3 canals.\n",
      "According to the canalolithiasis theory (the most widely accepted theory of the pathophysiology of benign positional vertigo), the otoliths are free-floating within the semicircular canal. Changing head position causes the otoliths to move through the canal. Endolymph is dragged along with the movement of the otoliths, and this stimulates the hair cells of the cupula of the affected semicircular canal, causing vertigo. When the otoliths stop moving, the endolymph also stops moving and the hair cells return to their baseline position, thus terminating the vertigo and nystagmus. Reversing the head maneuver causes the particles to move in the opposite direction, producing nystagmus in the same axis but reversed in direction of rotation. The patient may describe that the room is now spinning in the opposite direction. When repeating the head maneuvers, the otoliths tend to become dispersed and thus are progressively less effective in producing the vertigo and nystagmus (hence, the concept of fatigability). \n",
      "\n",
      "United States\n",
      "\n",
      "The incidence of benign positional vertigo (BPV) is 64 cases per 100,000 population per year (conservative estimate).[1] \n",
      "\n",
      "International\n",
      "\n",
      "One study in Japan found an incidence of 11 cases per 100,000 population per year, but patients were counted only if examined by a subspecialist or at a referral center. \n",
      "The B of BPV stands for benign and designates that the cause of the vertigo is peripheral to the brainstem and, hence, likely to be benign. However, BPV can be severely incapacitating to the patient.\n",
      "Women are affected twice as often as men.\n",
      "BPV, in general, is a disease of elderly persons, although onset can occur at any age. Several large studies show an average age of onset in the mid 50s. Vertigo in young patients is more likely to be caused by labyrinthitis (associated with hearing loss) or vestibular neuronitis (normal hearing). \n",
      "When asked about their dizziness, patients with benign positional vertigo (BPV) characteristically describe that the room or world is spinning. However, other descriptions, such as rocking, tilting, somersaulting, and the like, are also possible. All that matters is that an illusion of motion is caused by a misperception of a stimulus (the otoliths). Diagnosis of BPV is based on a characteristic history and a positive Hallpike test. \n",
      "Episodic vertigo may occur with the following head movements:\n",
      "Rolling over in bed\n",
      "Lying down\n",
      "Sitting up\n",
      "Leaning forward\n",
      "Turning the head in a horizontal plane\n",
      "Symptoms of BPV are usually worse in the morning (the otoliths are more likely to clump together as the patient sleeps and exert a greater effect when the patient gets up in the morning) and mitigate as the day progresses (the otoliths become more dispersed with head movement). \n",
      "Nausea is typically present (vomiting is less common).\n",
      "A history of head trauma may be present, especially in young patients with BPV. The head trauma may dislodge the otoliths off the hair cells within the utricle, allowing them the opportunity to enter the semicircular canals. \n",
      "Eliciting that the individual episodes of vertigo in BPV last for seconds at a time is important. Patients may describe that they are having continuous vertigo, when in reality, they are having repeated episodes (with each episode typically lasting seconds or less than a minute). Patients with vestibular neuritis and labyrinthitis have continuous vertigo, often for hours to days. \n",
      "During the interview, if patient states that the \"room is spinning\" while the patient's head is still and prior to any manipulative tests, then it is highly unlikely that the patient has BPV because the vertigo in BPV lasts for seconds at a time and occurs only after head movement. \n",
      "In addition to the patient's history, a diagnosis of benign positional vertigo (BPV) is confirmed by a positive Hallpike test (see video below).[2, 3] \n",
      "In this test, the patient is placed in the head-hanging position after turning the head 45 degrees to one side. After a short delay of a few seconds, nystagmus and reproduction of the vertigo occurs and typically resolves within 30-60 seconds. In general, the Hallpike test will be positive on one side (the side with the otoliths in the posterior semicircular canal) and negative on the other side. The neurologic examination is otherwise unremarkable. \n",
      "Nystagmus (an involuntary rhythmic oscillation of the eyes) is described in terms of the fast-phase component.\n",
      "Classic nystagmus occurs when the patient's head is dependent and turned to the affected side.\n",
      "The nystagmus is torsional or rotatory. In the head-hanging position, the fast phase should beat toward the forehead (upbeat) and in the same direction as the affected side (ipsilateral). Although some describe the fast phase in terms of being clockwise or counterclockwise, most experts avoid this terminology because it can be unclear if the clock is being viewed from the patient's or physician's perspective. \n",
      "Nystagmus usually occurs within 10 seconds after positioning but may present as late as 40 seconds. Hence, if the history is classic, observe the patient for at least 40 seconds while he or she is in the head-hanging position during the Hallpike test. \n",
      "The duration of the observed nystagmus varies from a few seconds to a minute and parallels the sensation of vertigo.\n",
      "Response fatigues if the patient is repeatedly placed into the provoking position (due to dispersion of the otoliths).\n",
      "Note: If the patient has a classic history of BPV (after a short delay, the room spins, but then revolves in 20-30 seconds, and then the rooms spins in the opposite direction when he or she sits back up) but no nystagmus is seen during the Hallpike test, most experts would agree to treat the patient with the modified Epley maneuver because nystagmus may be blocked by fixation suppression and emergency physicians do not have access to Frenzel lenses that specialists use to block fixation suppression (see Treatment). \n",
      "One study showed that treating such patients with the Epley maneuver is still effective (despite the lack of nystagmus). Again, these patients should have a classic history and be symptomatic during Hallpike testing. \n",
      "Perform the Hallpike test as follows (Caution: For patients with cervical spondylosis, it may not be advisable to extend the neck. However, because having the head dependent is important, the same effect can be achieved if the gurney is placed in the Trendelenburg position for such patients).\n",
      "First, warn the patient that symptoms of vertigo will likely be reproduced but will resolve after a few seconds.\n",
      "Seat the patient close enough to the end of the gurney so that when he or she lies supine, the head can extend backward an additional 30-45°.\n",
      "Instruct the patient to keep his or her eyes open because you want to observe the direction of the nystagmus. The examiner may need to use his thumb to hold the eyelid open because patients may involuntarily close their eyes even when instructed to keep them open.\n",
      "To test the left posterior canal, follow these steps: \n",
      "Turn the patient's head 45° to the left. This position orients the head such that the left posterior semicircular canal is going to be in the same plane as the upcoming head movement (next step). This is the most provocative way to move the otoliths (if they are indeed in the posterior semicircular canal) which will result in a positive test. \n",
      "With your hands on either side of the patient's head, lay the patient down until the head is dependent (hanging over the edge of the gurney). Note that this step does not need to be performed rapidly. \n",
      "Check for reproduction of symptoms and nystagmus. In most cases, the fast phase of the nystagmus should be upbeat (toward the forehead) and ipsilateral (in this example, toward the patient's left). \n",
      "Return the patient to the upright position. Nystagmus may be observed in the opposite direction, and the patient may describe that the world is spinning in the opposite direction. \n",
      "To test the right posterior canal, repeat the Hallpike test with the head turned 45° to the right side. In general, if the patient has BPV, only one side should test positive during the Hallpike test. Although having bilateral posterior semicircular canal BPV is possible, it is unlikely and should suggest horizontal canal involvement, vestibular neuritis/labyrinthitis, or a central cause. \n",
      "Note that many patients experience mild dizziness when being brought up from the head-hanging position to the sitting position. It is important not to confuse this dizziness (which is more lightheaded in character) with true vertigo. \n",
      "If the patient's head cannot be extended over the edge of the gurney, 2 additional options exist. The first is to place the patient in the Trendelenburg position if a gurney that allows this position is available. The other alternative is to use the side-lying test; the patient sits with his or her legs over one side of the gurney. To test the left posterior semicircular canal, turn the patient's head 90° to the opposite side (in this case, the right side). Then, lay the patient on his or her left side. By turning the patient's head to the right, the left posterior semicircular canal is aligned in the same plane as the sideways movement. As in the Hallpike test, this will allow the greatest chance for otoliths to move if they are indeed located in the posterior semicircular canal. \n",
      "The neurologic examination findings should be otherwise normal; if not, strongly consider alternative diagnoses.\n",
      "Several disorders affecting the peripheral vestibular system may precede the onset of benign positional vertigo (BPV).\n",
      "Idiopathic (50-60%)\n",

      "Head CT scanning or MRI is indicated if the diagnosis is in doubt.\n",
      "Although most patients with benign positional vertigo (BPV) have posterior semicircular canal involvement, some patients have horizontal canal involvement. This canal should be suspected if the patient has bilateral symptoms during the Hallpike test. Use the Roll test to formally diagnose horizontal canal BPV, and use the bar-b-que treatment to treat horizontal canal BPV. \n",
      "Have the patient lie in the supine position on the gurney. Unlike the Hallpike test, the head does not need to hang over the edge of the gurney.\n",
      "Turn the patient's head 90° to one side. The patient should experience a reproduction of symptoms and the presence of horizontal nystagmus. The fast phase should beat toward the earth (geotropic).\n",
      "Now, turn the patient's head 180° (or 90° to the opposite side). The patient should again experience a reproduction of symptoms and the presence of horizontal nystagmus. The fast phase again beats toward the earth (note that it has changed direction). This is known as direction-changing nystagmus (nystagmus that changes direction based on turning the head) and is different from gaze-evoked nystagmus (which is nystagmus that changes direction depending on where the patient is looking, as in Dilantin toxicity). \n",
      "Note that both sides will have nystagmus and a reproduction of symptoms, but one side will be much more symptomatic (and demonstrate stronger nystagmus) than the other side. This is considered the involved side. \n",
      "A positive Roll test should be treated with the bar-b-que treatment (see Treatment and the video below).\n",
      "The head-thrust test is used to diagnose vestibular neuritis and labyrinthitis. \n",
      "In this test, the patient is told to look at the examiner's nose. The examiner places both his or her hands on the patient's head and rapidly turns it approximately 10-15° to one side. If the vestibular apparatus is functioning properly, the patient will be able to maintain his or her focus on the examiner's nose. If the vestibular apparatus is not working properly, the patient's eyes will deviate to the side and then quickly jerk back to view the examiner's nose. This jerking eye movement is called a saccade and indicates a positive head-thrust test. As a general rule, a positive head-thrust test rules in a peripheral (and hence benign) cause of vertigo. There are reported cases, however, of positive head-thrust tests in central causes of vertigo. \n",
      "The Hallpike test, along with the patient's history, confirms the diagnosis of BPV. See Physical for details of this procedure. \n",
      "The modified Epley maneuver is used to treat posterior canal BPV (see Treatment as well as the video below for a demonstration).[4] \n",
      "If the history and physical examination are typical, no further evaluation is necessary, and the emergency physician may proceed with the modified Epley maneuver described below (see the video below).\n",
      "If the history and physical examination findings are atypical, consider other causes of positional vertigo, which may occur with tumor or infarcts in the posterior fossa.\n",
      "Contraindications to performing the Epley maneuver include ongoing CNS disease (ie, stroke or transient ischemic attack [TIA]), unstable heart disease, severe neck disease (eg, rheumatoid arthritis) or history of cervical spine fracture or surgery, carotid bruit on examination indicating carotid stenosis, or body habitus preventing performance of the maneuver.\n",
      "Further information on diagnosis and treatment guidelines and recommendations are available from the American Academy of Neurology and the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation.[2, 5] \n",
      "The goal of the Epley maneuver is to move the otoliths out of the posterior semicircular canal and back into the utricle where they belong. \n",
      "The success rate of the Epley maneuver is approximately 80%. When it fails, it is the author's experience that it is either being incorrectly applied to patients with vestibular neuritis or labyrinthitis, or that the patient raised his/her head too high in the 3rd part of the Epley maneuver, in which the patient rolls onto the side and looks towards the ground. \n",
      "The head must be in the dependent (head-hanging) position for this maneuver to work. If the patient does not tolerate this position, put the gurney in the Trendelenburg position to simulate this head-hanging position.[6] \n",
      "Maintain each position until the symptoms and nystagmus have disappeared or for at least 30 seconds.\n",
      "If the patient cannot tolerate the maneuver because of vomiting or severity of the vertigo, premedicate with a vestibular sedative, such as 4 mg IV ondansetron (Zofran). \n",
      "Have the patient sit upright on the gurney with the head turned 45° to the affected side. Recall that the affected side was predetermined by using the Hallpike test. Make sure the patient is sitting far enough back in the gurney so that the head will hang over the edge of the gurney when the patient is laid back. Make sure the guardrail on the opposite side has been lowered (the patient will eventually sit up so his or her legs overhang the edge of the gurney). See the image below.\n",
      "Place your hands on either side of the patient's head and guide the patient down with the head dependent (as in the Hallpike test). See the image below.\n",
      "Rotate the head 90° to the opposite side with the patient's face upward and be sure to maintain the head-dependent position (head is hanging over the edge of the gurney).\n",
      "Ask the patient to roll onto his or her side while holding the head in this position and then rotate the head so that it is facing downward (tell the patient to look to the ground). See the images below.\n",
      "Raise the patient to a sitting position while maintaining head rotation (This author finds that sitting the patient up so that he or she is sitting with his or her legs hanging over the edge of the gurney is easier. This is why the side guardrails need to be lowered before the procedure is started). See the images below.\n",
      "Simultaneously rotate the head to a central position and move it 45° forward.\n",
      "This maneuver is primarily used in Europe. Although it can be used to treat classic posterior canal BPV, in the United States, it is usually reserved to treat the cupulolithiasis form of BPV (where the otoliths are not free-floating but instead are attached to the cupula of the posterior semicircular canal). Because of its somewhat violent nature (and the fact that most patients with BPV are elderly), the author does not advocate its use but includes it to be complete.\n",
      "As in the side-lying test, the patient sits on the edge of the gurney with the head turned opposite to the involved side. The patient is brought rapidly down onto his or her side (this serves to dislodge the otoliths off the cupula). The patient is then rapidly brought to the other side, maintaining the head in the same position (so the patient's face will be facing the gurney). The patient is then brought to the original sitting position. See the video below.\n",
      "Neurologic consultation is indicated for cases of positional vertigo and nystagmus that do not satisfy criteria for BPV. For example, downbeat (fast phase beating towards the feet) nystagmus is more likely to indicate a central cause of vertigo as opposed to peripheral vertigo caused by anterior semicircular canal involvement, the latter of which is extremely rare. \n",
      "Medical treatment for benign positional vertigo (BPV) is generally ineffective but may be used to lessen the symptoms.[5] The natural history of BPV is to resolve with time as most otoliths eventually dissolve while in the semicircular canals. \n",
      "The use of vestibular suppressants is based on the sensory conflict theory, in which sensory input is compared from different systems, and if a conflict exists, then vertigo, nausea, and vomiting result. Over time, habituation occurs. Several main neurotransmitters mediate these functions: GABA, acetylcholine, and histamine/serotonin. \n",
      "The antihistaminic antiemetics block the emetic response. For patients with severe vertigo or vomiting, intravenous promethazine (Phenergan) used to be the drug of choice; however, this medication recently received a Black Box Warning from the FDA and is now only recommended to be given intramuscularly. Prochlorperazine (Compazine) is an alternative antiemetic. Meclizine is given orally and does not work fast enough to be effective acutely. Most antiemetics have anticholinergic activity as well.\n",
      "Antidopaminergic agent used to treat emesis. Blocks postsynaptic mesolimbic dopaminergic receptors in the brain and reduces stimuli to brainstem reticular system. Also has cross reactivity with the cholinergic receptors. \n",
      "Decreases excitability of middle ear labyrinth and blocks conduction in middle ear vestibular-cerebellar pathways. These effects are associated with relief of nausea and vomiting. \n",
      "Blocks action of acetylcholine at parasympathetic sites in the smooth muscle, secretory glands, and CNS. Antagonizes histamine and serotonin action.\n",
      "Transdermal scopolamine may be most effective agent for motion sickness. Use in the treatment of BPV is limited by slow onset of action. \n",
      "Mixture of 1:1 salt consisting of 8-chlorotheophylline and diphenhydramine. Believed to be useful, particularly in treatment of vertigo. Diminishes vestibular stimulation and depresses labyrinthine function through central anticholinergic effects. However, prolonged treatment may decrease rate of recovery of vestibular injuries. \n",
      "These agents are an option for treating emesis associated with BPV. They may be administered IV, IM, or orally, including an orally disintegrating tablet and oral soluble film. \n",
      "Ondansetron selective 5-HT3 receptor antagonist; binds to 5-HT3 receptors both in periphery and in CNS, with primary effects in GI tract. It has no effect on dopamine receptors and therefore does not cause extrapyramidal symptoms. \n",
      "These agents block the GABA receptors and serve as the \"brakes\" to the system. Although they can be used acutely in the ED, they are not recommended for long-term use because they interfere with the process of vestibular rehabilitation. \n",
      "Sedative hypnotic in benzodiazepine class that has short time to onset and relatively long half-life. Depresses all levels of CNS, including limbic and reticular formation, probably through increased action of GABA, a major inhibitory neurotransmitter. \n",
      "Head exercise therapy (positional exercises of Brandt and Daroff) that promotes central accommodation may be helpful for BPV, although most patients have difficulty tolerating these maneuvers. The patient can perform the following therapy:\n",
      "Sit on the edge of the bed near the middle, with legs hanging down.\n",
      "Turn the head 45° to the right side. Quickly lie down on the left side, with the head still turned, and touch the bed with a portion of the head behind the ear. \n",
      "Maintain this position and every subsequent position for about 30 seconds.\n",
      "Sit up again.\n",
      "Quickly lie down to the right side after turning head 45° toward the left side.\n",
      "Sit up again.\n",
      "Do 6-10 repetitions, 3 times per day.\n",
      "If the patient becomes confused about the direction to turn his or her head, tell the patient his or her nose should always point toward the ceiling. \n",
      "Patients with persistent vomiting or intractable vertigo may require admission for hydration and vestibular suppressant medication.\n",
      "Surgical elimination of posterior canal function is restricted to rare cases of long-standing refractory benign positional vertigo (BPV). \n",
      "Meclizine is the most common outpatient medication. This medication is indicated for vertigo but should not be given for other categories of dizziness (near-syncope, dysequilibrium, or lightheadedness). \n",
      "Avoid provocative movements and limit activities.\n",
      "No complications (eg, neck injury, vertebral dissection) other than vomiting have been reported from the use of the Epley maneuver. \n",
      "Benign positional vertigo (BPV) tends to resolve spontaneously after several days or weeks. An Italian researcher removed the otoliths from an animal, placed them in a Petri dish full of endolymph, and noted that the otoliths dissolved in approximately 100 hours. \n",
      "Patients may experience recurrences months or years later (if the otoliths got out once, they can do it again).\n",
      "Variants range from a single, short-lived episode to decades of vertigo with only short remissions.\n",
      "A study by Kim et al assessed patients who were discharged home from the ED with a diagnosis of isolated dizziness or vertigo and determined that stroke occurs in less than 1 in 500 patients within the first month.[7] Cerebrovascular risk factors should be considered for individual patients. \n",

      "This article primarily reviews cleft lip and palate (CLP) and issues directly related to these anomalies, including secondary deformities and velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI). Cleft lip and palate deformity can be distinguished from an isolated cleft palate (CP) on the basis of epidemiologic, embryonic, and genetic factors.[1] The etiology of cleft lip and palate or cleft palate is believed to be multifactorial. \n",
      "The scope of this field precludes in-depth discussion of surgical techniques and controversies. Miscellaneous deformities, such as the Robin sequence, macroglossia, ankyloglossia, and epignathus are briefly highlighted. \n",
      "The image below depicts embryonic formation of the primary palate.\n",
      "Two thirds of all cases of clefting involve the lip with or without involvement of the palate, whereas one third of all cases occur as an isolated deformity of the palate. Males predominate within the cleft lip and palate (CLP) group (60-80% of cases), whereas females constitute the majority within the cleft palate (CP) group. Cleft lip and palate deformity is strongly associated with bilateral cleft lips (CLs) (86% of cases); the association decreases to 68% with unilateral cleft lip. The left side is most commonly involved in unilateral cleft lip cases. \n",
      "Interracial differences exist in the incidence of cleft lip and palate versus cleft palate. The mean incidence of cleft lip and palate is 2.1 cases per 1000 live births among Asians, 1 case per 1000 live births among white people, and 0.41 cases per 1000 live births among black people. A high incidence of the cleft lip and palate is seen in North American populations of Asian descent, such as Indians of the southwestern United States and the west coast of Canada. The incidence of isolated cleft palate is constant among the 3 racial groups at 0.5 cases per 1000 live births. \n",
      "The incidence of cleft lip and palate also rises with increased parental age, and older mothers with additional parity have an increased incidence of having children with cleft palate. \n",
      "In relatives of children with cleft lip and palate, the incidence of cleft lip and palate is significantly increased. However, the isolated cleft palate anomaly occurs with the same frequency as that in the general population. Relatives of children with isolated cleft palate also have a higher risk of this anomaly, without an increased risk of the cleft lip and palate deformity. \n",
      "Overall, 5% of patients with cleft lip and palate and isolated cleft palate have identifiable syndromes. Associated syndromes are more common among patients with isolated cleft palate than among others. \n",
      "The following image depicts the normal palate anatomy.\n",
      "Go to Cleft Lip, Bilateral Cleft Lip Repair, Cleft Palate Repair, and Unilateral Cleft Lip Repair for complete information on these topics.\n",
      "The overall development of the palate involves the formation of the primary palate followed by the formation of the secondary palate.At approximately 30-37 days' gestational age (GA), the primary palate forms by the growth and fusion of the medial nasal, lateral nasal, and maxillary processes (see the image below). The maxillary process, derived from the proximal half of the first arch, grows to meet and fuse with the nasal processes that have grown and moved in association with the olfactory placode. General opinion holds that mesodermal penetration underlies the formation of the primary palate. Mesodermal reinforcement along lines of fusion is important, as epithelial breakdown and clefting is thought to result from the lack of reinforcement.\n",
      "The secondary palate arises from the 2 palatal shelves, which are initially are in a vertical position because of the interposed tongue. With extension of the head at 7 weeks' GA and mandibular growth, the tongue is withdrawn, and the palatal shelves can swing into a more horizontal and midline position for fusion and formation of a hard and soft palate (see the following image). The cleft of the hard palate and soft palate is thought to occur because of the intervening tongue, which impedes elevation of the palatal shelves.\n",
      "Various classification schemes have been devised in the last 70 years for cleft lip and palate, but few have received widespread clinical acceptance. Four of the more accepted schemes are highlighted below. \n",
      "The Davis and Ritchie classification divides cleft lip and palate into 2 groups, which subdivided into the extent of the cleft (eg, 1/3, 1/2), as follows: \n",
      "Group I - Clefts anterior to the alveolus (unilateral, median, or bilateral cleft lip)\n",
      "Group II - Postalveolar clefts (cleft palate alone, soft palate alone, soft palate and hard palate, or submucous cleft)\n",
      "The Veau classification system divides the cleft lip and palate into 4 groups, which are as follows and illustrated in the image below: \n",
      "Group I – Defects of the soft palate only\n",
      "Group II – Defects involving the hard palate and soft palate\n",
      "Group III – Defects involving the soft palate to the alveolus, usually involving the lip\n",
      "Group IV – Complete bilateral clefts\n",
      "The Kernahan and Stark classification highlights the anatomic and embryonic importance of the incisive foramen that is formed during weeks 4-7 gestational age (GA). The secondary palate forms the roof of the mouth from the incisive foramen to the uvula during weeks 7-12 GA (see the image below).\n",
      "This system provides a graphic classification scheme using a Y-configuration, which can be divided into 9 areas, as follows (see also the image below)[2] : \n",
      "Areas 1 and 4 – Lip\n",
      "Areas 2 and 5 – Alveolus\n",
      "Areas 3 and 6 – Palate between the alveolus and the incisive foramen\n",
      "Areas 7 and 8 – Hard palate\n",
      "Area 9 – Soft palate\n",
      "The International Confederation of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery classification system uses an embryonic framework to divide clefts into 3 groups, with further subdivisions to denote unilateral or bilateral cases, as follows: \n",
      "Group I – Defects of the lip or alveolus\n",
      "Group II – Clefts of the secondary palate (hard palate, soft palate, or both)\n",
      "Group III – Any combination of clefts involving the primary and secondary palates\n",
      "Koul introduced a method for documenting all types of cleft lip and cleft palate for data storage and communication.[3] This \"Expression System\" incorporates the actual words for the anatomical structures affected by clefts and can describe accurately and easily, without the need for consulting reference materials, the location and extent of both typical and atypical clefts. The Expression System overcomes several limitations of previous cleft registration methods, and its simplicity and precision benefits all those involved in the care of patients with cleft lip/palate by furthering the interdisciplinary and intradisciplinary approach. \n",
      "Comprehension of the anatomic deformities is central to understanding the principles of their surgical repair. The following section briefly describes the anatomic abnormalities in the patient with cleft lip and palate (CLP) by discussing the muscular, neurovascular, structural, and nasal deformities. \n",
      "Failure of the muscles to meet their counterparts during embryonic development leads to the functional abnormalities of clefts of the lip and palate.[4] The nonfunctional substitute attachments lead to atrophy of the muscle units or maladaptive accommodation. Modern cleft lip and palate surgical repair involves detachment of musculature from atypical locations and realignment in a more anatomically functional position.[4] \n",
      "The orbicularis oris muscle is the primary muscle of the lip and can be divided functionally and anatomically into 2 parts (see the image below).[4] The deep component, in concert with other oropharyngeal muscles, works in swallowing and serves as a sphincter. The superficial component is a muscle of facial expression and inserts into the anterior nasal spine, sill, alar base, and skin to form the philtral ridges.\n",
      "In a complete cleft lip (CL), the deep fibers of the orbicularis oris muscle are interrupted by the cleft and end on either side of the defect instead of making their way around the mouth. In addition, the superficial component of the orbicularis oris turns upward, along the margins of the cleft and ends beneath the ala or columella.[4] \n",
      "Incomplete cleft lip behaves in a similar manner, except when the cleft is less than two thirds of the height of the lip.[4] In this case, the fibers of the muscle run along the margins of the cleft, then change direction and run horizontally over the top of the cleft. These muscle fibers are interspersed with connective tissue. \n",
      "The blood vessels parallel the course of the muscle fibers and run along the margins of the cleft toward the columella or alar base, where they form anastomoses with nearby vessels. \n",
      "In the bilateral deformity, the anatomic characteristics are determined by the degree of completeness of the cleft and its symmetry. The cleft may involve the primary palate alone or in conjunction with the secondary palate. Although the prolabium varies in size, it is usually retracted and lacks muscle fibers. In addition, the columella is absent and the prolabium appears attached to the top of the nose in some cases. The size and position of the premaxilla vary and effectively can be excluded with a collapse of the alveolar arch. \n",
      "The extent of nasal deformity associated with cleft lip varies from patient to patient, although it has a characteristic appearance, with the following features: \n",
      "Deflection of the nasal tip towards the noncleft side\n",
      "Retroplacement of the cleft alar cartilage dome\n",
      "Obtuse angle between the medial and lateral crura of the lower lateral cartilage on the cleft side\n",
      "Buckling of the ala on the cleft side\n",
      "Absence of the alar-facial groove on the cleft side and attachment of the ala to the face at an obtuse angle\n",
      "Apparent or real bony deficiency of the maxilla on the cleft side\n",
      "Larger nares on the cleft side\n",
      "Shorter columella on the cleft side, positioning the entire columella at a slant toward the noncleft side\n",
      "Inferior displacement of the medial crus within the columella\n",
      "Dislocation of the caudal portion of the septum to the noncleft side from the nasal spine\n",
      "Downward rotation of the alar cartilage on the cleft side\n",
      "Bilateral deformity in which the nasal tip appears large, flat, and bifid, because both alae are rotated downward and spread apart \n",
      "The incisive foramen is the key landmark in the bony palate (see the image below). The premaxilla lies anterior to the incisive foramen and includes the 2 premaxillary bones: the alveolus and the incisors.\n",
      "The soft-tissue structures in the primary palate include the nasal tip and the upper central lip. The size, composition, and configuration of the premaxilla can vary from full development with the complement of teeth (4 primary and 4 secondary) to underdevelopment with only 2 incisors. If the premaxilla is unrestrained in the intrauterine and neonatal period it can protrude from the arch; the maxillary arches may then collapse and potentially exclude the premaxilla from the arch. \n",
      "Posterior to the incisive foramen lies the secondary palate, comprising the hard palate and soft palate. The hard palate forms from the palatine processes of the maxilla anteriorly and the palatine bones posteriorly. Posterior to the bony hard palate lies the soft palate. \n",
      "The soft palate plays an important role in speech and swallowing. Paired muscle on both sides of the midline (see the following image) form the musculature of the soft palate. The levator veli palatini is the most important muscle for the production of speech and velopharyngeal competence. The paired muscles of the soft palate function as a sling from their origin at the undersurface of the temporal bone to their aponeurosis across the midline, as they elevate the soft palate toward the posterior pharyngeal wall. \n",
      "The palatopharyngeus further supplements the posterior movement of the soft palate. Contraction of the superior pharyngeal constrictor contributes to closure of the velopharyngeal opening at the lateral and posterior pharyngeal wall. The primary function of the tensor veli palatini is to dilate the eustachian tube and to maintain its integrity. The uvular muscle is thought to have a minimal contribution to normal speech.\n",
      "Clefts of the palate (CPs) are associated with bony, as well as soft-tissue, abnormalities. Clefts of the secondary palate may be isolated or associated with clefts of the primary palate. Although clefts of the secondary palate are midline defects (see the image below), those involving the primary palate are usually asymmetric, with the vomer attached to the noncleft side. The dental arch on the noncleft side usually splays outward due to the lack of restraining force from the lip, and the palate is foreshortened in the anteroposterior direction. In the case of complete bilateral clefts, the entire premaxilla protrudes from the adjacent alveolar ridges. Because of the collapse of the palatine shelves posterior to the premaxilla and its possible rotation, the premaxilla is prevented from rejoining the arch and is left attached solely to the vomer.\n",
      "Soft-tissue defects of the cleft palate include hypoplasia of the velar musculature in addition to anomalous insertions of its muscular components (see the following image). The normal midline insertion and transverse orientation of the levator palatini is substituted by an aberrant longitudinal orientation and insertion along the bony cleft margin and posterior palatine bones. Other palatal muscles are affected similarly. Dysfunction results in speech pathology with velopharyngeal incompetence and in eustachian-tube obstruction with resultant middle-ear effusion, infections, and possible hearing loss.\n",
      "Using cone-beam computed tomography (CT) scanning, a study by Celikoglu et al found at least one maxillary dental anomaly in 50 patients with nonsyndromic cleft lip and palate, with tooth agenesis being the most frequent. The study, of 22 and 28 patients with bilateral and unilateral cleft lip and palate, respectively, found tooth agenesis in 86.4% of the bilateral patients and 92.5% of the unilateral patients. In the unilateral group, the incidence of tooth agenesis and canine impaction were greater on the cleft side of the mouth than on the normal side.[5] \n",
      "A study by Datana et al indicated that the prevalence of upper cervical vertebrae anomalies is more than three times greater in persons with cleft lip/palate than in those without the condition. The prevalence was 20.3% in the cleft group overall, compared with 6.4% in the control group. In patients with unilateral cleft lip and palate, the prevalence was 22.2%, while in those with bilateral cleft lip and palate, the prevalence was 19.1%, and in patients with cleft palate only, the prevalence of upper cervical vertebrae anomalies was 16.6%. The study involved 128 patients with cleft lip/palate and 125 controls.[6] \n",
      "Neonatal management, unilateral and bilateral cleft lip repair, presurgical orthodontics, and cleft palate repair are discussed in this section. \n",
      "A minority of patients, particularly those with the Robin sequence (see Robin sequence under Selected Mouth and Pharynx Deformities), present with respiratory distress. Securing the airway is the priority in these patients. However, feeding difficulty is the primary problem for most patients with cleft lip and palate (CLP). Although these patients have normal sucking and swallowing reflexes, they have difficulty generating enough negative pressure to nurse adequately. As a result, the baby's nutrition must be delivered through bottle feeding via nipples with large openings to facilitate the delivery of breast milk or formula. \n",
      "A multidisciplinary approach is required to assist patients and their families with the comprehensive care of these children. Responsibility for their care is shared by a team of pediatricians, plastic surgeons, otolaryngologists, pedodontists, orthodontists, nurses, speech therapists, audiologists, and social workers. \n",
      "Repair of the unilateral cleft lip (CL) is usually performed during the first year of life. Although some surgeons advocate immediate repair, most follow the “rules of 10”: hemoglobin more than 10 g, age older than 10 weeks, and weight more than 10 lb. Patients who satisfy the criteria can better tolerate general anesthesia, and surgeons can perform a more technically accurate surgical repair. \n",
      "Discussion of the merits of individual surgical procedures for correction of the cleft lip (CL) is beyond the scope of this review. All contemporary procedures use local tissue flaps for reconstruction and closure of the congenital anomaly. Interested readers are urged to refer to surgical atlases or the following: \n",

      "Presurgical orthodontics facilitate repositioning of the palatal segments into normal alignment with the use of an appliance.[7] The simplest device is adhesive tape placed across the cheeks and prolabium of patients with bilateral clefts. Splints can also be used to maintain or adjust the alignment of the premaxilla while the patient awaits definitive cleft lip repair. These appliances have the potential to convert a wide complete cleft lip to an incomplete lip. In addition, preoperative realignment of the segments decreases tension on the wound and incidence of wound dehiscence. \n",
      "The bilateral cleft lip deformity is unique, because its management and postoperative results are affected by the status of the premaxillary segment and the degree of symmetry and completeness of the deformity. The goals of surgical correction of a bilateral cleft lip include correction of the cleft lip (CL) and nasal deformity in addition to establishment of a normal relationship between the premaxilla and the alveolar arches. Presurgical orthodontics are used to realign the maxillary arch and premaxilla and to minimize the tension placed on the lip closure.[7] \n",
      "El-Kassaby et al (2013) published a retrospective comparative study of nonsyndromic patients with complete bilateral cleft lip and palate.[8] The patients were divided into 2 groups based on the size and characteristics of the premaxilla: group R for rudimentary premaxilla and group P for prominent premaxilla. The width of the cleft at the hard palate level and the gap between the soft palate and the posterior pharyngeal wall were the most significant parameters in predicting velopharyngeal insufficiency.\n",

      "The goals of cleft palate (CP) repair include closure of the palatal defect and attainment of normal speech, hearing, dental occlusion, and facial and palatal growth. The timing of surgical correction remains controversial. Factors considered before repair must take into account the known and postulated affects on facial growth and speech development.[9, 10] \n",
      "The trauma sustained during surgical intervention is thought to play a role in the underdevelopment of the midface. The persistence of a cleft deformity, per se, is not believed to affect normal craniofacial growth. Patients with cleft deformities that are left surgically uncorrected have been observed to have normal maxillary growth. \n",
      "The development of speech is somewhat independent of craniofacial growth. That vocalization begins with birth is well known. In addition, an intact speech mechanism is required to ensure that the correct neural programming needed for integration of the musculature involved in speech occurs. This process is thought to transpire within the first year of life. Once established, compensatory speech patterns are difficult to change. \n",
      "Common opinion maintains that although early palatal repair is associated with superior speech and hearing, it has negative effects on facial growth. Operative intervention at a younger age is also technically more challenging because of the small size of the structures and the limitations of the instruments. \n",
      "Most centers in North America perform palatal closure at age 12-18 months. Patients in this age group have larger anatomy, which facilitates surgical intervention. In addition, common belief asserts that normal speech development is not impeded at this age. \n",
      "Surgical repair of the cleft palate falls into 2 categories. The first is a single-stage repair involving closure with mucoperiosteal flaps. The second involves a multistage approach in which the soft palate is closed initially, followed by a delayed closure of the hard palate. \n",
      "In a 2008 retrospective study by Khosla et al concluded that the Furlow Z-plasty yielded excellent speech results for primary cleft palate repair with minimal and acceptable rates of fistula formation, velopharyngeal insufficiency, and the need for additional corrective surgery. \n",
      "Distraction osteogenesis is a relatively recent technique used for maxillary advancement to correct skeletofacial deformities in older cleft patients. In 2008, Bevillaqua et al published results with this technique on 7 patients with significant anterior movements, which allowed excellent improvements in functional and facial aesthetic outcomes.[11] \n",
      "For more information regarding cleft palate repair, see Cleft Palate Repair.\n",
      "A competent velopharyngeal mechanism is required for normal speech. The velopharyngeal sphincter functions in concert with the mouth and larynx for speech production. The palate separates the nasal cavity from the vocal tract and forms a part of the velopharyngeal sphincter. Closure of the sphincter is accomplished by the movement of the soft palate (tension and elevation) as well as lateral and posterior movement of the posterior pharyngeal wall. \n",
      "Velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI) results from an inability to completely close the velopharyngeal sphincter. Velopharyngeal insufficiency is characterized by hypernasality; nasal emission; and adaptive changes in articulations, such as pharyngeal fricatives, sound substitution, and glottal stops. \n",
      "The goal of palatal repair is to restore accurate phonation and functional anatomy. Most techniques of palatal repair result in a 20-30% incidence of velopharyngeal insufficiency. \n",
      "If a child is found to have velopharyngeal insufficiency based on speech derangement, additional quantitative and dynamic measurements are required. Pressure and airflow measurements, both oral and nasal, are generally used only as screening tools, because they provide no details about sphincter function. \n",
      "In order to compare nasendoscopy (NE) with multiview fluoroscopy (MVF) in the assessment of velopharyngeal gap size and to determine the relationship between these assessments and velopharyngeal insufficiency severity, Lam et al demonstrated that NE and MVF assessments provide complementary information and are correlated.[12] Both are associated with velopharyngeal insufficiency severity. However, the bird's-eye view provided by NE has a stronger correlation with velopharyngeal insufficiency severity than MVF. \n",
      "Radiologic methods of assessment include soft-tissue radiography and videofluoroscopy. Radiography provides a 2-dimensional (2-D) image of the relationship between the soft palate and the posterior pharyngeal wall, but it is not a dynamic technique. Conversely, videofluoroscopy provides dynamic information regarding the sphincter mechanism. Flexible and rigid endoscopy can also be used to assess velopharyngeal insufficiency. The advantage of endoscopy is that it allows direct observation of sphincter function.\n",
      "VPI can be surgically corrected with the use of pharyngeal flaps,[13] pharyngeal sphincter reconstruction (pharyngoplasty), or pharyngeal wall implants.\n",
      "Yang et al (2013) published a retrospective review on 503 patients.[14] They found that velopharyngeal competence (VPC) scores were statistically higher in patients operated at age younger than 2 years compared with older age groups (P < .05) and significantly lower in the 6 years-or-older group (P < .05). They also concluded that the postoperative velopharyngeal function (VPF) greatly decreases after age 6 years. \n",
      "Leclerc et al (2013) published on anatomical measurements of the cleft palate that predict the occurrence of VPI after palatal cleft repair.[15] They concluded that the width of the cleft at the hard palate level and the posterior gap between the soft palate and the posterior pharyngeal wall were the most significant parameters in predicting velopharyngeal insufficiency. \n",
      "The Robin sequence, macroglossia, ankyloglossia, epignathus, lingual thyroid, and a few other conditions are briefly discussed in this section. \n",
      "The Robin sequence includes cleft palate (CP), a small mouth, and retrognathia. Retrognathism results in a functional abnormality of the tongue musculature that manifests with airway obstruction during sleep, as the tongue falls posteriorly. In addition to the respiratory difficulties, feeding difficulties can result in a failure to thrive. \n",
      "The severity of airway compromise dictates management. In mild cases, conservative treatment consists of placing the patient in a prone position and intensive monitoring. Surgery is indicated if no improvement occurs after 7 days. Surgery involves either tracheostomy or repositioning of the tongue. \n",
      "For more information, see Pierre Robin Syndrome.\n",
      "Congenital macroglossia may be secondary to tumors (eg, dermoids), muscular hypertrophy or hyperplasia (Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome), or hemihypertrophy. Vascular malformation is a common cause of macroglossia.[16] Macroglossia may interfere with speech or deglutition. In addition, the exposed tongue can become dry, cracked, and ulcerated. Oral hygiene and drooling can be problematic. \n",
      "Lymphangiomas are the most common vascular malformations of the tongue. Surgical biopsy or relatively minor trauma to the patient with lymphangioma can result in massive swelling, with difficulty in closing the mouth or, at times, airway compromise. Increased swelling can occur with superimposed lymphangitis. Early in life, conservative treatment is recommended; this includes the avoidance of trauma and the prompt use of antibiotics at the first sign of infection. Surgery is usually delayed until the child is older (4-5 y) to decrease the likelihood of postoperative airway problems. \n",
      "Macroglossia is a feature of Down syndrome. The etiology is believed to be a reactive hypertrophy due to muscular hypotonia. The combination of macroglossia and a small oral cavity in these patients results in glossoptosis. Partial glossectomy is usually successful in returning the tongue to the oral cavity and in removing this visible stigma of mental retardation. \n",
      "Macroglossia can also be associated with a few syndromes, such as Treacher Collins (mandibulofacial dysostosis or Franceschetti-Zwahlen-Klein) syndrome. \n",
      "Ankyloglossia is due to the presence of a frenulum tethering the tip of the tongue to the floor of the mouth. The commonly used term to describe ankyloglossia is tongue-tied. Problems with articulation may affect sounds that require placement of the tongue on the upper incisor teeth, as in the /th/ sound. In Spanish-speaking persons with this condition, rolling of the tongue to produce the /r/ sound is particularly difficult. \n",
      "Surgical intervention is indicated for articulation problems and for feeding difficulties (poor suckling), dental problems (spreading of the lower incisor teeth), or requests by the patient's parents. Release may involve simple division of the involved band of tissue or a Z-plasty lengthening procedure. Injury to the Wharton duct should be avoided. \n",
      "Epignathi are rare teratomas that histologically contain tissue of all 3 germ-cell lines.[17] Patients usually present at birth with a mass that protrudes through the mouth and compromises the airway (see the image below). Grossly, the tumor is covered with skin and mucosa and appears to arise from the palate or pharynx, filling the oral cavity. These masses are thought to arise from pluripotential stem cells from the Rathke pouch region.\n",
      "Prenatal ultrasonography usually demonstrates the mass protruding from the fetal face.[18] The differential diagnosis should include hairy polyps, encephaloceles, gliomas, and dermoids. \n",
      "Management involves emergently securing an airway by intubation or formal tracheostomy. A magnetic resonance image (MRI) (or computed tomography [CT] scan) is required before surgical intervention to rule out an encephalocele or intracranial extension of the lesion. Once the extent of the mass is adequately determined, the tumor can be excised through the oral cavity. \n",
      "A lingual thyroid is due to the undescended thyroid at the tongue base. Common symptoms include dysphagia; dysphonia; and, occasionally, dyspnea. Thyroid ultrasonography has replaced radioisotope thyroid scanning in the evaluation of the amount of active thyroid tissue present. \n",
      "Management depends on functional and metabolic factors. If the patient is euthyroid, observation with careful follow-up is advised. Suppressive thyroid hormone therapy should be initiated if a hypothyroid status develops. If the lingual swelling increases, surgical excision with replacement therapy is indicated. \n",
      "Lip pits represent vestigial remnants of the lateral sulci of the mandible at the 7.5- to 12.5-mm stage of the embryo. In van der Woude syndrome (an autosomal dominant syndrome with 90% penetrance), lip pits are paramedian and usually bilateral. They vary in depth from a few millimeters to 3 centimeters or more. A communication may exist with the minor salivary glands of the lower lip. Lip pits may also occur in popliteal pterygium syndrome and in aganglionic megacolon with cleft lip and palate (CLP). \n",
      "Commissural lip pits occur more frequently than other lip pits and are not related to the syndromes just described. Their prevalence is estimated to be 1 case per 300 white persons and 1 case per 48 black persons. \n",
      "Micrognathia could be associated with numerous syndromes and conditions, such as an adducted thumb, atelosteogenesis (types I and III); cerebrocostomandibular findings; the Robin sequence; and Aase-Smith, Chitayat-Azouz, chromosome 3 dup 3p, chromosome 4 partial del 4p, chromosome 7 term del 7q, Say, and Shprintzen (velocardiofacial) syndromes.[19] \n",

      "Upper airway obstruction occurring during sleep—that is, sleep-disordered breathing (SDB)—was first demonstrated in the 1960s. SDB represents a group of physiopathologic conditions that are characterized by an abnormal respiratory pattern during sleep that can be isolated or can coexist with other respiratory, nervous, cardiovascular, or endocrine diseases. SDB is now known to be widely prevalent in the general population, and it is responsible for or contributes to numerous problems, ranging from fragmented sleep patterns to hypertension to traffic accidents.[1, 2] \n",
      "SDB includes obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which consists of breathing cessations of at least 10 seconds occurring in the presence of inspiratory efforts during sleep. Central sleep apnea consists of similar apneas, but these instead take place in the absence of inspiratory efforts.[3, 4, 5, 6, 7] \n",
      "The obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) is a potentially disabling condition characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness,[8] disruptive snoring, repeated episodes of upper airway obstruction during sleep, and nocturnal hypoxemia. It is defined by an apnea-hypopnea index (the total number of episodes of apnea and hypopnea per hour of sleep), or respiratory disturbance index, of 5 or higher in association with excessive daytime somnolence. \n",
      "Risk factors for sleep apnea include obesity, increased neck circumference, craniofacial abnormalities, hypothyroidism, and acromegaly. Daytime consequences include not only excessive sleepiness but also impaired cognitive performance and disturbed moods with a reduced quality of life. Excessive daytime sleepiness is reported to be associated with a higher risk of motor vehicle accidents and work place injuries or poor work performance .\n",
      "In general, everyone with SDB snores, but not everyone who snores has SDB. Snoring in the absence of SDB is termed primary or simple snoring. However, some evidence indicates that snoring is one end of a clinical continuum with an opposite extreme of severe OSA. Some health problems may be associated even with primary snoring. \n",
      "Upper airway resistance syndrome (UARS) is characterized by snoring with increased resistance in the upper airway, resulting in arousals during sleep. This can disturb sleep architecture to the point of causing daytime somnolence. No distinct diagnostic criteria exist for this entity. Patients with UARS can be treated with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (n-CPAP).[9, 10] \n",
      "Treatment involves elimination of contributing factors and provision of n-CPAP. n-CPAP is effective in improving sleep quality and reducing daytime sleepiness. Long-term treatment with n-CPAP reduces both mortality and the acute blood pressure elevation that occurs with SDB.[11] Over time, a trend develops toward baseline blood pressure reduction in hypertensive patients with SDB. Medical and surgical interventions may also be indicated. \n",

      "For patient education information, see the Sleep Disorders Center, as well as Snoring and Narcolepsy.\n",
      "Any factors that decrease upper airway size or patency during sleep can lead to intermittent obstruction during inspiration, despite inspiratory effort. If the obstruction is sufficiently prolonged, blood-oxygen levels drop. Then, the patient arouses or awakens. The arousals disrupt normal sleep architecture. These, together with the oxygenation drops, are responsible for the more severe accompaniments of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB), including hypertension, arrhythmias, and death.[12] \n",
      "Factors affecting upper airway size or patency include numerous anatomic variants and abnormalities (eg, nasal obstruction, retrognathia, macroglossia), obesity, alcohol or sedative intake, and body position during sleep. \n",
      "Obesity contributes to SDB by changing pharyngeal size and shape. Fat storage in the neck may be particularly associated with risk for SDB, although a subset of patients with SDB are of normal body weight. Many of these patients have a family history of snoring or SDB. \n",
      "Alcohol intake near bedtime can cause or worsen SDB by reducing the activity of the upper airway dilating muscles. Alcohol increases both the number and duration of apneic or hypopneic events. \n",
      "Racial studies and chromosomal mapping, familial studies, and twin studies have provided evidence for a possible link between the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) and genetic factors. Genetic factors associated with craniofacial structure, body fat distribution, and neural control of the upper airway muscles likely interact to produce the OSAS phenotype.[13, 14, 15] \n",
      "Although the role of specific genes that influence the development of OSAS has not yet been identified, current researchers, especially in the animal model, suggest that several genetic systems may be important. \n",
      "Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)–DQB1*0602 allele, a well-known genetic risk factor for narcolepsy, has been described as a potential genetic factor influencing sleep physiology in individuals diagnosed with OSAS.[16] \n",
      "Polymorphisms in the serotonin (5-HT) receptor gene can alter its transcription, affecting the number of receptors in the serotoninergic system, contributing to OSAS.[17] \n",
      "Important clinical risk factors for SDB are as follows: \n",
      "Nasal obstruction\n",
      "Craniofacial abnormalities\n",
      "Mandibular retrognathia\n",
      "Micrognathia\n",
      "Narrowed, tapered, and short maxillary arch\n",

      "Tonsillar hypertrophy\n",
      "Neck circumference more than 17 inches for men and more than 16 inches for women\n",
      "Obesity\n",
      "Other problems that can contribute to or exacerbate SDB are sedative or alcohol use and poor sleep hygiene.\n",
      "A very small percentage of patients with SDB have central rather than obstructive sleep apnea. Central sleep apnea can be caused by various neurologic disorders or can be idiopathic. \n",
      "All the epidemiological studies indicate that sleep apnea is more common in men than in women (the male-to-female ratio is 2-3: 1). Sleep apnea occurs in 4% of men and 2% of women aged 30-60 years. A retrospective study on 830 patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) reports a male-to-female ratio (M:F) that increases with the gravity of the disease: 2.2:1 in mild OSAS and 7.9:1 in severe OSAS.[18] Hypersomnolence is reported with a percentage of 16% in men and 22% in women, while 24% of men and 9% of women have an apnea-hypopnea index of at least 5. \n",
      "The discrepancy between the lower prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), the greater frequency of obesity, and the smaller airway size in women compared with men suggests that a gender difference underlies this condition. \n",
      "Men tend to have a larger but more collapsible airway during mandibular movement than women and this, in part, may play a role in the positional dependency and severity of OSA in men. \n",
      "Another possible reason for the lower prevalence of OSAS may be reluctance on the part of many women to report symptoms mostly considered inappropriate, like snoring; this reluctance may cause a clinical underestimation of the problem in females. \n",
      "The gender-related protective effect decreases in females who are postmenopausal and not on hormone replacement therapy.[19, 20] \n",
      "The association between age and obstructive sleep apnea is complex. Several studies have shown a higher prevalence of OSA in elderly persons than in middle-aged persons, although daytime symptoms may be less common with advancing age. \n",
      "The Sleep Heart Health Study demonstrated that the influence of male sex and body mass index (BMI) on obstructive sleep apnea tends to wane with age. For unclear reasons, the overall prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea plateaus after age 65 years.[21] \n",
      "The prevalence of OSAS among African-American persons seems to be at least equal to and possibly greater than that among white persons. The prevalence among men in urban India and men and women in Korea is similar to that observed in Western countries. Some researchers have noticed an increased incidence of OSA in persons of Asian origin. \n",
      "Excessive daytime sleepiness resulting from SDB can impact focus and concentration, causing decreased work effectiveness. Even mild-to-moderate SDB increases reaction time, causing performance decreases similar to alcohol intoxication. This can lead to motor vehicle accidents and other serious accidents in situations where alertness is required for safety (eg, heavy machinery operators). \n",
      "Moderate-to-severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with earlier death. The cardiovascular sequelae of untreated OSA include hypertension, cor pulmonale, arrhythmias, and increased risk of myocardial infarction or stroke.[22, 23, 24, 25, 26] SDB is associated with higher levels of interleukin-6, a marker of myocardial infarction risk and mortality.[27] Adiposity may mediate the increased levels of C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and P-selectin observed in SDB.[27] \n",
      "OSA is associated with difficult-to-control hypertension.[28] Treatment of OSA may reduce new first-time cerebrovascular events and recurrences.[29] \n",
      "Recent studies have examined the relationship between OSA and glucose tolerance, and many have shown a direct and independent relationship between OSA and diabetes. The Wisconsin Sleep Study Cohort showed a greater prevalence of diabetes in subjects with increasing levels of OSA.[30] Several studies have shown a beneficial effect of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy on insulin resistance or glucose levels.[31, 32, 33] \n",
      "The probable mechanisms connecting OSA with glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes mellitus includes the increased sympathetic activity, the sympathovagal dysfunction, alterations in neuroendocrine function (especially in growth hormone [GH] and cortisol levels), high inflammatory state with an increase in the release of proinflammatory cytokines.[34, 32, 33, 35, 36] \n",
      "The first clue in the history of patients with SDB is loud snoring. This is accompanied by breathing cessation; gasping, choking, and snorting; frequent arousals from sleep; and respiratory effort with no air. Nocturnal arrhythmias and acute blood pressure increases may occur. Morning headaches that dissipate as the day goes on, excessive daytime sleepiness, and poor concentration affect daytime performance. The disorder has been linked to an increased risk of angina, myocardial ischemia, stroke and motor vehicle crashes. \n",
      "Older men may report getting up numerous times during the night to urinate and are convinced that they awaken because of the urge to urinate. The truth is often the reverse, that they awaken as a result of SDB and only then notice the urge to urinate. These patients are often surprised at their decreased need for nocturnal urination after successful SDB treatment. \n",
      "Laryngopharyngeal reflux can cause a patient to suddenly awaken from sleep, gasping for breath. A feeling of terror is often present. \n",
      "Inadequate sleep time can cause excessive daytime sleepiness. This may be involuntary, as in insomnia, or voluntary. Insomnia is characterized by the inability to fall asleep or awakening during the night and being unable to fall back to sleep. Inadequate sleep time occurs for other voluntary reasons (eg, working more than one job, family responsibilities). \n",
      "Patients with hypothyroidism can also present with fatigue, daytime somnolence, and obesity. SDB and hypothyroidism can coexist.[37] \n",
      "Narcolepsy can also cause excessive daytime sleepiness.\n",
      "Most patients with SDB are overweight or obese. A patient with a short, thick neck may be predisposed to SDB. Scalloped indentations along the lateral tongue (from teeth) are a marker for relative tongue/mandibular arch size mismatch, which may predispose individuals to SDB. \n",
      "Children with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) are likely to present with normal body weight, tonsillar hypertrophy, and inattentiveness during school classes.[38] However, OSAS in children is not discussed in this paper. \n",
      "If not adequately diagnosed and treated, OSAS is associated with severe complications such as hypertension, strokes, coronary disease, and neurobehavioral complaints and is probably a predictor of premature death. At least 50% of patients with heart failure have sleep respiratory apneas, and patients with moderate-to-severe OSAS have a 3-fold increased risk of developing hypertension.[22, 23, 24, 25, 26] \n",
      "The differential diagnosis of SDB includes the following: \n",
      "Simple snoring\n",
      "Central sleep apnea\n",
      "Other disorders that cause daytime sleepiness (eg, insufficient sleep, a circadian-rhythm abnormality, narcolepsy, periodic limb movement disorder). \n",
      "The relation between snoring, obstructive sleep apnea, and hypothyroidism has been confirmed by many authors. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels should be determined in patients who are newly diagnosed with SDB because SDB is relatively common among patients with hypothyroidism. Significant increases in homocysteine levels have been observed in obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) patients with cardiovascular disease. \n",
      "Radiologic and diagnostic studies have been used to identify the obstruction site, direct surgical intervention and predict outcomes of sleep apnea surgery. These studies include lateral cephalometric radiographs, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), asleep fluoroscopy, asleep and awake endoscopy with Mueller maneuver, upper airway manometry, and acoustic reflection techniques.[39] \n",
      "Most of those techniques have limitations (dynamic and tridimensional evaluation) in the mechanism of occlusion investigation. Ultrafast MRI provides a reliable and noninvasive method for static and dynamic evaluation of the soft tissue structures surrounding the upper airway during the respiratory cycle in wakefulness and sleep. \n",
      "The Epworth Sleepiness Scale is a questionnaire filled out by the patient that is used to provide a standardized semiquantitative subjective assessment of daytime sleepiness. \n",
      "In this questionnaire, patients are instructed to rate the chance of dozing off in a number of different situations. They are to choose the most appropriate ranking for each of these situations, working out how they would probably respond if it is something they have not actually done recently. Scoring for the Epworth Sleepiness Scale is shown in the table below. \n",

      "Polysomnography (PSG) is the criterion standard diagnostic test for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). A respiratory event suggestive of OSAS is defined as a decrease in nasal and oral airflow, alone or with thoracoabdominal movements, more than 90% (apnea) or more than 50% and less than 90% (hypopnea) that lasted for at least 10 seconds. A decrease in arterial oxygen saturation of 4% or more is considered significant oxygen desaturation.[40] \n",
      "Information from PSG is reported in the form of the respiratory disturbance index (RDI) (also referred to as the apnea-hypopnea index [AHI]). The RDI is the number of apneas or hypopneas 10 seconds or longer occurring per hour of sleep. A normal RDI is less than 5. A RDI less than or equal to 5 is considered suggestive of simple snoring with no OSAS. Greater than 5 and less than or equal to 15 is suggestive of mild OSAS. More than 15 and less than or equal to 30 is suggestive of moderate OSAS. Finally, more than 30 is suggestive of severe OSAS. \n",
      "The loudness and persistence of snoring (constant versus intermittent) are usually reported. Body position is also recorded so one can determine what position (usually supine) and in what sleep phase (usually rapid eye movement [REM] sleep, when muscle tone is most relaxed) the patient is in when respiratory events occur. \n",
      "In-laboratory PSG is the criterion standard for diagnosing OSAS. However, PSG has several limitations, including the necessity of performing the test in a sleep laboratory, high costs, the considerable technical expertise required, and the long analyzing time needed by the operator. In addition, the examination often needs to be repeated because of the interference of monitoring electrodes with the physiological sleep of the patient (“first night effect”). Therefore, timely access to PSG is often a problem. \n",
      "Because PSG is expensive and not widely available, an extensive interest in alternative diagnostic approaches, such as clinical prediction rules and portable monitors, has been expressed. A limited number of questionnaires are available to detect some sleep disorders, but those instruments do not achieve the reliability of PSG, which remains the recommended method of assessing patients with suspected sleep disorders. The role of those questionnaires is mainly of a screening tool for identifying patients at risk for OSAS.[41, 42, 43, 44] \n",
      "Many questionnaires have been developed for screening OSAS. The Rome Questionnaire (RQ) is a 7-item questionnaire useful in identifying adult patients at risk of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. The RQ, together with BMI, is reported to be a useful tool to select patients at higher risk of moderate-severe OSAS, who need a prompt PSG evaluation.[45] \n",
      "Home sleep testing pursues the goal of simplify the diagnosis of sleep apnea while retaining the essential recording features of PSG. Recent studies have suggested that home sleep studies have benefits in terms of time and cost, but for diagnostic reliability, an in-laboratory sleep study may be required in more than half of the cases. \n",
      "Various types of ambulatory (to be used at home) monitors can measure parameters such as airflow, chest, and abdomen movements (as indicators of respiratory effort); oxygen desaturations; snoring; pulse; and body position.[46, 47] \n",
      "Although the data from such studies are not as detailed or accurate as an overnight PSG, these studies can often be used to differentiate primary snoring from snoring with apneas and can usually provide an indication of the frequency with which apneas are occurring. In contrast, techniques that measure only one parameter (eg, home oximetry alone) seem to be less accurate than those that track several measurements. \n",
      "EdenTrace portable monitor measures nasal and oral air flow using thermistors, chest wall impedance, oxygen saturation with finger pulse oximetry, heart rate, and movement detected by electrical comparison of the signals from electrocardiography and pulse oximetry. \n",
      "The MESAM IV system evaluates SDB based on an analysis of snoring, heart rate, and saturation change. Even if in many studies there is a good agreement between the RDI measured in the laboratory and with the home sleep testing, there is a risk that ambulatory diagnostic procedures may alter the relationship of patients to their disease and/or the medical staff so that subsequent compliance with treatment may be decreased. \n",
      "The Nightwatch system has the ability to calculate the RDI. It records eye movement (1 channel, piezo electrode), leg movement (1 channel, piezo electrode), (finger pulse oximeter), nasal oral airflow (thermistor), chest and abdominal movements (piezo electrodes), body position and movement (mercury gauge placed on the chest), and heart rate. \n",
      "The Nightwatch system also has the ability to send 2-minute portions of the complete recording to the laboratory for analysis so that signal quality can be assessed and transducer function corrected if needed. However, further studies are necessary before this technology can be put into widespread use.\n",
      "In order to develop a simpler, cheaper, and more accessible method for the diagnosis of OSAS, the peripheral arterial tonometer (PAT) has been proposed as a new method in ambulatory diagnosis of OSAS. The portable monitoring device WatchPAT 200 detects obstructive events by identifying the changes in sympathetic activity associated with the termination of the events. The wrist-worn device WatchPAT 200, compared with standard polysomnography (PSG), has been reported to be able to detect OSAS based on apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) with comparable accuracy.[48] \n",
      "Acoustic analysis of snoring sounds may help differentiate between primary snoring and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Other researchers have investigated the combination of clinical variables such as neck and chest circumference, BMI, and resting room air oxygen saturation; however, none of these has been shown to differentiate consistently between primary snorers and patients with significant apneas and desaturations during sleep. \n",
      "The histology of the soft palate and uvula in snorers and patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) has been investigated by many authors.[49, 50] Some authors observed muscular atrophy, dilatation and congestion of the blood vessels, lymphocytic infiltrations, and hypertrophy of superficial salivary glands localized between the muscle bundles and epithelium. Those histopathologic changes were related to the influence of the vibration on the soft palate and uvula and were considered responsible for the excessive flaccidity of these structures. \n",
      "Other authors have observed similar contents of glands, muscle, fat, blood vessels, and the epithelium in the uvula and the soft palate of either OSAS or control subjects. \n",
      "Drug-induced sleep endoscopy (DISE) is a safe and reliable technique to determine the pattern of upper airway obstruction and the contribution of specific structures to airway obstruction.[51] \n",
      "Identifying the site and the dynamic pattern of obstruction is mandatory in therapeutical decision-making, and, in particular, if a surgical therapy option is taken into consideration.[52] \n",
      "The nose, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and larynx (NOHL) classification, which could be applied during awake and sleep endoscopy, allows a simple, quick, and effective evaluation of grade and patterns of upper airway collapse.[53] \n",
      "The first task in treating patients with SDB is to eliminate all possible contributing factors. This includes weight loss for patients who are obese and elimination of alcohol or sedative use, especially near bedtime. Benzodiazepines, narcotics, and barbiturates can worsen SDB, or sometimes they initiate it where it had not previously been present. \n",
      "A 10% weight loss was associated with a 26% decrease in the AHI (RDI) in a population-based study. Weight loss should be recommended for all obese patients with sleep apnea; however, weight loss takes time, and only a minority of patients successfully maintains it.[54, 55] \n",
      "Body positioning during sleep can improve SDB in some patients. Because lying supine can allow gravity to assist in pulling lax tongue muscles back toward the posterior pharyngeal wall, patients should sleep on their sides, on their stomachs, or propped up 60°. These positions can improve SDB in patients whose symptoms occur primarily while supine. \n",
      "Avoidance of supine sleeping can easily be accomplished with a sock, tennis ball, and safety pins. The tennis ball in a sock is pinned to the back of the pajamas, positioning the tennis ball between the scapulae. When the patient rolls into the supine position during sleep, this lump is uncomfortable enough that the position is immediately shifted, usually without the patient awakening. \n",
      "In patients with hypothyroidism and SDB, thyroid hormone replacement therapy is usually accompanied by an improvement in the SDB. \n",
      "In some individuals, a mouthpiece may improve the anatomy of the airway to the point where snoring or mild obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) can be corrected. Many types of oral appliances have been designed for the treatment of sleep apnea. Most are custom fitted to the teeth of both dental arches to reposition the mandible and to enlarge the retropalatal and retrolingual airway space. However, consistent patient tolerance for this treatment is relatively low, and it is less effective than CPAP in reducing the frequency of apnea and hypopnea.[56] \n",
      "Multidisciplinary sleep teams, including pulmonologists, otolaryngologists, neurologists, and oral-maxillofacial surgeons, may offer the most convenient and comprehensive treatment for these patients. \n",
      "Diet and exercise counseling play a major role in the initial therapy for SDB.\n",
      "Weight reduction in the patient with obesity can dramatically improve SDB. Even a modest weight loss can have quite a beneficial effect on the frequency of apneas and hypopneas. Bariatric surgery may be needed in some cases. When rapid weight loss occurs after bariatric surgery or successful dieting, the pressure for overcoming apneas and hypopneas is likely to decrease, so retesting is recommended. \n",
      "When none of the above therapies are appropriate or helpful, nasal continuous positive airway pressure (n-CPAP) is the most effective method to manage obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS).[57, 58, 59, 4, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 55, 70] \n",
      "n-CPAP provides a pneumatic stent for the upper airway, eliminating the airway collapse during inspiration. It is administered by a soft mask that covers the nose only. Sufficient pressure is introduced to eliminate apneas, hypopneas, and snoring. An image depicting a CPAP machine can be seen below. \n",
      "Most physicians agree that patients with a respiratory disturbance index (RDI) higher than 20 require treatment. n-CPAP can also be useful for patients with a lower RDI, especially if they experience daytime sleepiness or other symptoms. If the severity of the daytime symptoms and the Epworth Sleepiness Scale score are much greater than would be expected with a particular RDI, a trial of n-CPAP can help determine whether elimination of the SDB leads to improvement of the daytime symptoms or if other factors contribute to the daytime symptoms. \n",
      "Patients who are unlikely to benefit from n-CPAP include those with such severe nasal obstruction that n-CPAP cannot be used, patients with such extreme claustrophobia that they cannot tolerate a nasal mask, and patients in whom n-CPAP does not reliably eliminate apneas, hypopneas, and snoring. \n",
      "The criterion standard for determining the amount of pressure required to restore upper-airway patency is traditionally determined during polysomnography (PSG) by trained technicians. In some centers, this is performed as a split-night study, with data from the first half of the night used for diagnosis of SDB. Once this diagnosis is made, if the RDI is sufficient to suggest benefit from initiation of n-CPAP (usually an RDI of 20 or higher), the second half of the night’s study is used to determine the optimal amount of pressure. \n",
      "The disadvantage of the split-night approach is that the second half of a full night study often reveals more severe sleep apnea, so a diagnostic study limited to the first half of the night can underestimate disease severity. \n",
      "The amount of pressure delivered is reported as cm water. An average starting point for CPAP would be 8-10 cm water. Patients report that pressures at these levels feel odd but are tolerable even when beginning treatment and become more tolerable as the patients become accustomed to treatment. Higher levels (>15 cm water) are often not well tolerated. \n",
      "When a second overnight study is logistically difficult, some clinicians empirically start a patient on n-CPAP with a pressure of 8-10 cm water. A new generation of n-CPAP machines, on the basis of the patterns of inspiratory airflow, can sense the amount of pressure needed to overcome upper airway resistance. Patients are sometimes started using these machines without a prior titration study.[71, 72] \n",
      "Alternatively, an autotitrating machine can be used for several nights, the record of amount of pressure required to suppress apneas and hypopneas can be downloaded and studied, and a suitable nightly pressure can be determined in this fashion. Also, the amount of pressure required to suppress snoring can be used as an audible guide to appropriate pressures. \n",
      "A patient who routinely takes sedatives or ingests alcohol during the evening and does not intend to change this should probably be tested after continuing their usual nightly routine. n-CPAP titration without sedatives or alcohol is likely to lead to undertreatment of the SDB at home, when such patterns are resumed. \n",
      "Most patients feel better during the daytime on the first day after beginning n-CPAP. During the first week of treatment, most experience rebound sleep with prolonged episodes of REM sleep. Sleep patterns become more normal after the first week. For these reasons, several weeks of n-CPAP use may be helpful for normalization of sleep patterns in patients with severe sleep apnea who plan to undergo surgery. Sleep patterns should be normalized prior to the planned surgery. \n",
      "Regular use of n-CPAP improves both the patients’ and their bed partners’ quality of life.[73, 74, 75] The treatment lessens depressive symptoms, and improves daytime functioning, blood pressure and insulin sensitivity. In patients with OSA who receive antihypertensive treatment, long-term CPAP was found to be responsible for a significantly reduction of diastolic blood pressure. Asthmatic OSA patients have fewer nighttime symptoms.[76, 66, 77] \n",
      "Other effects of using CPAP include increased vagal tone, increased cardiac output, increased stroke volume, decreased systemic vascular resistance, and reduced risk of cardiovascular mortality.[11] \n",
      "Patients with OSA often have increased arterial stiffness and sympathovagal imbalance. CPAP therapy is reported to have beneficial effects on the vascular function in such patients: improvement of the sympathovagal balance by CPAP therapy may be significantly related to decreased stiffness of the central to middle-sized arteries, independent of the changes in the blood pressure and vascular endothelial status.[78] \n",
      "Repetitive obstructive apnea produces acute impairment of left ventricular longitudinal function, suggesting the development of subendocardial ischemia. CPAP therapy not only decreases the severity of OSA but also ameliorates sleep-induced longitudinal left ventricular dysfunction. \n",
      "One problem with n-CPAP is that although n-CPAP provides good improvement in symptoms and physiologic parameters, compliance with treatment is not good, with regular use sometimes estimated as low as 30% (46% in one study defining use as at least 4 h/d, 5 d/wk). Noncompliance has been categorized by Zoula et al as tolerance problems, psychological problems, and lack of instruction, support, or follow-up.[79] \n",
      "Tolerance problems may be due to side effects (ie, dry mouth, conjunctivitis, rhinorrhea, skin irritation, pressure sores, nasal congestion, epistaxis), mask leaks, difficulty exhaling, aerophagia, chest discomfort, and bed-partner intolerance.[73] Psychological problems include lack of motivation, claustrophobia, and anxiety. The suggestions below for dealing with some of these problems may assist the physician in improving treatment compliance. \n",
      "Many patients report claustrophobia. They find that the sensation of covering the nose with a mask makes them so uncomfortable that they cannot tolerate wearing the n-CPAP. Sometimes this can be helped with a smaller or more transparent mask design. Use of nasal pillows (inserted into the nostrils) instead of a formal nasal mask may allow such patients to tolerate the n-CPAP. \n",
      "Some patients have trouble tolerating the initial pressure. Especially when higher pressures (>12-13 cm water) are required for elimination of apneas and hypopneas, this level of pressure may be uncomfortable. Many n-CPAP machines have a built-in ramp or gradual increase in pressure. Using this feature, the mask can be placed and pressure begun at a very low and easily tolerated level. Over 30 minutes, the pressure gradually builds to the full amount necessary. Often, the patient can fall asleep during this time. Full pressure is not used until the patient is actually asleep. \n",
      "Patients may experience nasal obstruction. Evaluation by an otolaryngologist reveals whether this is predominantly a fixed skeletal obstruction or a soft tissue obstruction potentially modifiable without surgery. Marked septal deviation or turbinate hypertrophy usually requires surgery for resolution. Alar collapse may be adequately treated by internal or external dilators (eg, Breathe Right strip, Nozovent). Surgery is sometimes required for repair of marked alar collapse. \n",
      "Mucosal edema may be due to allergic rhinosinusitis or to vasomotor or irritative rhinitis. Allergy testing and treatment and pharmacotherapy trials (eg, topical steroids or antihistamines, oral antihistamines, or decongestants) may be beneficial. \n",
      "One way to determine whether sufficient potentially reversible mucosal edema exists to pursue that avenue of treatment is the topical decongestant test. The patient uses a nasal topical decongestant (eg, oxymetazoline) at bedtime for several days, with the patient and bed partner observing for any improvements in snoring or apneas. A marked improvement suggests potentially reversible mucosal edema as a main contributor to the nasal obstruction. Failure to improve suggests a fixed skeletal obstruction that requires surgical correction. \n",
      "Sometimes the dryness of the air or its temperature may be irritating to the patient. Use of in-line humidification and warming of the inspired air may alleviate patient discomfort.[80, 81] \n",
      "A number of patients report facial or nasal pain. Sometimes this pain can be related to a poorly fitting mask. With the many different types of masks available now, different styles and sizes can be tried to select the optimal fit for each individual anatomy. Because the mask is pulled tight against the face, an edentulous anterior maxilla may not provide the resistance necessary for a good fit. Leaving dentures in at night can help with this. \n",
      "If the facial or nasal pain persists despite mask refitting, evaluation for nasal obstruction or chronic sinusitis may be helpful. The CPAP Pro delivery method anchors the tubing to a platform based on an upper retainer, obviating the need for a forehead strap. \n",
      "Patients may experience dry eye or other eye discomfort. If the mask does not seal well, egress of pressurized air from the upper end of the mask toward the eye may occur, causing dry eye or even exposure keratitis. Mask refitting usually eliminates this problem. \n",
      "Patients may sleep with the mouth falling open, awakening with dry mouth. Sometimes a chin strap is required to prevent the mouth from opening at night. A commercially available disposable adhesive bandage may used to pull the chin up toward the lower cheeks.[82] \n",
      "Patients may experience epistaxis. This may be related to the high-flow dry air and may be helped by humidification and warming of the inspired air. \n",
      "Some patients experience nasal drying. Forced dry air can be irritating to the nose, encouraging mucosal inflammation and crusting. Use of humidified air for n-CPAP usually eliminates this problem. \n",
      "Other problems may also occur. Pneumopericardium has been reported with n-CPAP.[83] Pneumocephalus has occurred when n-CPAP was used in a patient with cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea. Eustachian tube dysfunction, serous otitis media, bulging of the eardrums, and eardrum perforation have also been reported. \n",
      "Rigorous patient education and early reinforcing follow-up may improve long-term use of n-CPAP.\n",
      "Variations of air pressure delivery can sometimes make n-CPAP use more comfortable for patients.\n",
      "Autotitrating positive airway pressure (APAP) continually adjusts the pressure to barely overcome the collapsing forces. Bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) provides higher pressure during inspiration (when the pneumatic splint is needed to prevent obstructive airway collapse) and lower pressure during expiration. C-Flex is another autoadjusting delivery method that increases pressure toward the end of expirations, as collapse would usually begin, and decreases pressure during early expiration. \n",
      "Patients who require higher pressures to overcome obstructive apneas may tolerate these devices better than the one-level n-CPAP, which delivers the higher pressure throughout the entire respiratory cycle. \n",
      "Following treatment with CPAP, some patients with obstructive sleep apnea remain sleepy despite effective CPAP, and attention should be paid to other diagnoses that can be associated to sleepiness. The so called “post-CPAP sleepiness,” as a specific disorder, may not exist. \n",
      "Because some of the effects of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) are due to hypoxia during sleep, the administration of oxygen would seem like a reasonable treatment. Although oxygen administration improves the lowest blood-oxygen saturation level during sleep and can improve some of the arrhythmias occurring during desaturation, repeated studies have not demonstrated sustained clinically significant improvement in SDB with oxygen administration. Some prolongation of apneas also occurs, particularly at the beginning of therapy. \n",
      "Oxygen administration may be beneficial in a subset of patients. Some patients with other coexistent pulmonary disorders may also benefit from use of oxygen in conjunction with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (n-CPAP). \n",
      "Protriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant, is the medication most studied in the treatment of SDB and does yield improvement in patients with this condition. This effect, however, appears to be mainly due to suppression of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Because sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is often most severe during REM sleep, less REM sleep can mean fewer apneas. \n",
      "Modafinil is a wake-promoting medication used in association with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) to treat patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). It has an action similar to that of sympathomimetic agents (like amphetamine and methylphenidate), although its pharmacologic profile is not identical to that of sympathomimetic amines. The precise mechanism through which modafinil promotes wakefulness is unknown. \n",
      "Headache and nervousness are the only adverse events reported. There is no benefit using Modafinil in patients with OSA who are not compliant with CPAP, so it should not be administrated in such cases. \n",
      "Other drugs that have been investigated for treatment of sleep apnea include progestational agents, aminophylline, acetazolamide, L-tryptophan, naloxone, baclofen, bromocriptine, chlorimipramine, and prochlorperazine. None of these have shown a consistently helpful effect on sleep-disordered breathing (SDB). \n",
      "Surgical care of sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is discussed more fully in Snoring and Obstructive Sleep Apnea, Surgery. Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (n-CPAP) is often used in the perioperative period to assure good ventilation even in the presence of postsurgical edema. Because of the use of analgesics and swelling of the soft tissues, the pressure needed to maintain a patent airway postoperatively may be greater than the patient had been using prior to surgery. \n",
      "Alcohol significantly worsens SDB. Eliminating use of alcohol, especially near bedtime, improves SDB.[84] \n",
      "Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (n-CPAP) does not cure or alter the underlying obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) but rather provides daily relief from the apneas, snoring, hypoxias, and consequent daytime symptoms. After long-term n-CPAP use, a carry-over effect is often noted; therefore, polysomnography (PSG) results on the first day or two off n-CPAP look remarkably improved. However, this carry-over is short lived, and usually within a week, the snoring, apneas, hypoxias, and daytime symptoms have returned to their original level. \n",
      "n-CPAP is highly successful in managing OSA, as long as it is used. Unfortunately, compliance with n-CPAP use is not great, with use for at least 4 hours a night on 5 of 7 nights occurring in only about one half of patients. For this reason, regular follow-up visits are mandatory for ensuring continued successful treatment. \n",
      "Some physicians see patients on a 3- to 4-month basis during their first year of n-CPAP use and yearly thereafter. Repeat sleep studies are obtained after major weight loss or gain or after major change in daytime symptoms. Many patients happily and successfully use n-CPAP for years. Others find sustained use impossible. These are the patients for whom surgery may be helpful. \n",
      "Even snorers whose PSG does not show SDB should be monitored periodically because they can progress to SDB with time, even without weight gain. \n",

      "Transient neonatal pustular melanosis is a benign, self-limited condition of unknown etiology.[1] Historically, the disorder was lumped together with vesicular and bullous lesions and called pemphigus neonatorum. It was not described as a separate entity until 1976, although it may have been recognized as early as 1961 and published under the name of lentiginosis neonatorum. Note the image below.\n",
      "\n",
      "United States\n",
      "\n",
      "Few reports of large numbers of screened infants are available; however, incidence has been reported to be as much as 2.2% in white infants and 4.4% in black infants. \n",
      "Neonatal pustular melanosis is a completely benign condition that is not known to cause any long-term sequelae.[2] \n",
      "Transient neonatal pustular melanosis is common in black infants. It can be observed in all racial groups, especially those with darker constitutive pigmentation, Latinos, South Asians, and those of Mediterranean extraction. \n",
      "The eruption is almost always present at birth but the clinical appearance or stage may vary.\n",
      "The primary lesions in neonatal pustular melanosis progress through 3 stages of development. Initially, they appear as rather uniform round 2-mm to 4-mm nonerythematous pustules. They are not clear vesicles; rather, they contain milky, purulent exudate. The pustules rupture easily. They are frequently missed because they are superficial and are usually wiped off easily in the delivery suite when the newborn is cleansed of vernix. Pustules on the thicker areas of skin such as the knees or palms may persist for several days.[3, 4] \n",
      "Next, a delicate collarette of thin white scale is left around the perimeter of each denuded pustule. Near-term infants, especially those delivered by cesarean delivery, may exhibit just the unbroken pustules, and term infants may have only macules remaining, usually with the telltale collarette of flaking epidermis.\n",
      "Lastly, within hours of exposure to the terrestrial environment, the central pigmented brown macule becomes apparent. The macules are round, have smooth and distinct borders, and are frequently confused for freckles. They may be profuse or sparse and typically are found under the chin and on the neck, upper chest, back, and buttocks. Occasionally, the palms, soles, and scalp are affected.\n",
      "When considering suspected neonatal pustular melanosis, the following should also be considered:\n",
      "Erythema toxicum neonatorum: These lesions are small papules on an erythematous base, contain predominantly eosinophils, and do not heal with postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. \n",
      "Congenital cutaneous candidiasis: The pustules are usually very inflamed and contain organisms on laboratory smear or biopsy.\n",
      "Impetigo: Pustules are inflamed and contain organisms on laboratory smear and culture.\n",
      "Congenital Langherhans cell histiocytosis: Widely distributed papules and pustules form adherent crusts, not frecklelike macules.\n",
      "Congenital varicella: Pustules are larger, numerous, generalized, and widely dispersed in the setting of an ill neonate with unstable vital signs.\n",
      "Miliaria: This characterized by clear vesicles (crystallina) or pustules (pustulosa) that erupt in a setting of hyperthermia.\n",
      "Herpes simplex: Lesions begin as vesicles, become turbid, and develop into pustules. The vesicles are grouped or clustered and contain multinucleated giant cells. \n",
      "Milia: This is characterized by firm, white, superficial, pin-head–sized papulelike cysts filled with keratin debris.\n",
      "Acropustulosis: The pustules predominate on the palms and soles and are not present at birth.\n",
      "The etiology is unknown. Some reports have described cases that evolved into erythema toxicum neonatorum;[5] however, in the author’s opinion, the disorders may coexist and are clinically distinct entities. \n",
      "If the appearance is typical of transient neonatal pustular melanosis, no further workup is indicated. If appearance is not typical, potassium hydroxide preparation, Gram stain, and Wright-Giemsa stain can support other diagnoses in the differential. In atypical cases, pustules can be cultured for bacteria and clustering of pustules should prompt polymerase chain reaction to identify possible herpes simplex.\n",
      "Wright-Giemsa stain of pustule contents demonstrates a predominance of neutrophils. Few, if any eosinophils are present. The brown macules are not true freckles or lentigines. Skin biopsy shows pigment incontinence characteristic of postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. The diagnosis of Langherhans cell histiocytosis can only be made by skin biopsy. \n",
      "No treatment is indicated. Reassure parents that neonatal pustular melanosis is a benign finding and that it disappears.\n",
      "Drug therapy currently is not a component of the standard of care for this condition.\n",
      "The brown macules fade over a period of several months.\n",
      "Neonatal pustular melanosis is self-limited. No morbidity is recognized.\n",

      "Physical abuse, a subset of child abuse, is defined in various ways by different states. However, common to all definitions is the presence of an injury that the child sustains at the hands of his or her caregiver. These injuries are also referred to as inflicted or nonaccidental injuries. Some states use broad definitions that encompass a wide range of injuries; other states use more narrow definitions that include specific signs and symptoms. Physical abuse can produce various injuries and injury patterns in children. This article focuses on several common examples of inflicted injury dealing with the skeleton (eg, fractures), skin (eg, burns, bruises), and CNS (eg, subdural hematoma [SDH], abusive head trauma [AHT], shaken baby syndrome [SBS]/shaking-impact syndrome).\n",
      "The federally funded Fourth National Incidence Study (NIS-4) is a congressionally mandated effort of the United States Department of Health and Human Services to provide updated estimates of the incidence of child abuse and neglect in the United States and measure changes in incidence from the earlier studies.[5] NIS defines physical abuse as a form of maltreatment in which an injury is inflicted on the child by a caregiver via various nonaccidental means, including hitting with a hand, stick, strap, or other object; punching; kicking; shaking; throwing; burning; stabbing; or choking to the extent that demonstrable harm results.[6] \n",
      "The advantage to a narrow definition is that it objectively states what is and is not physical abuse; however, such a clear delineation of circumstances likely fails to identify all possible cases of physical abuse (eg, pulling the child's hair, biting the child's skin). Definitions may also attempt to characterize the seriousness of injury; however, characterization is difficult because injuries vary greatly from mild redness on the buttocks that fades over several hours to injuries so severe that the child dies. Recent medical definitions focus more on the effect of the injury on the child and less on the perceived intention of the caregiver.\n",
      "Additionally, newer definitions also consider the sociocultural context in which the injury occurs; folk healing practices may cause the appearance of nonaccidental injury to the child. Finally, the effect of the physical abuse may not be limited to just the immediate injury findings. The National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect (NCCAN) estimated that 37% of children with maltreatment injuries developed a disability or special need, directly from the abusive actions or omissions of the child's caregivers.[7] Furthermore, NCCAN estimated that incidence of disabilities caused by or likely to have been caused by maltreatment was 147 per 1000 maltreated children.\n",
      "No one single cause has been identified that explains the occurrence of all cases of physical abuse. The multifactorial nature of physical abuse requires a more comprehensive amalgam of models and conceptual frameworks to account for the heterogeneous set of cases classified as physical abuse.\n",
      "Circumstances that may give rise to the occurrence of a child's injury via physically abusive actions have been organized into a typology having the following 5 subtypes:\n",
      "Caregiver's angry and uncontrolled disciplinary response to actual or perceived misconduct of the child\n",
      "Caregiver's psychological impairment, which causes resentment and rejection of the child by the caregiver and a perception of the child as different and provocative\n",
      "Child left in care of a babysitter who is abusive\n",
      "Caregiver's use of substances that disinhibit behavior\n",
      "Caregiver's entanglement in a domestic violence situation\n",
      "This typology describes commonly observed circumstances that may result in nonaccidental injury to children; however, it does not shed light on why the circumstance leads to a child's injury.\n",
      "It is impossible and inadvisable to consider physical abuse of a child as an isolated incident with one cause and one effect. The ecological model of human development and interaction is generally regarded as an ideal conceptual framework from which to approach the complex interactions among the caregiver, child, family, social situation, and cultural values leading to the nonaccidental injury or physical abuse of the child. Note the image below.\n",
      "The ecological model sees a child functioning within a family (microsystem), the family functioning within a community (exosystem), the various communities linked together by a set of sociocultural values that influence them (macrosystem), and all of these systems operating over time (chronosystem). Each of these system components is interactional in nature and affects one another. Similar events have different effects that depend on the period and circumstances in which the event occurs (eg, the child interacts and has an impact on the family, the family influences the child).\n",
      "Helfer builds on this ecological viewpoint and states that physical maltreatment arises when a caregiver and child interact around an event, in a given environment, with the end result being injury to the child.[8] Viewing maltreatment in this way allows consideration of the factors that the caregiver, child, and environment contribute to placing the child at risk for injury. The caregiver is viewed as having a personal developmental history, personality style, psychological functioning, and coping strategies. The caregiver often possesses expectations of the child, and a level of ability to nurture the child's development that meets the child's developmental and caregiving needs.\n",
      "The child may have certain characteristics that make providing care more complex; however, caution must be used in considering the child's contribution to the abusive interactions. A \"difficult\" child does not justify abusive treatment by a caregiver. Specific factors that may place the child at higher risk for physical maltreatment include prematurity, poor bonding with caregiver, medical fragility, various special needs (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), and the child being perceived as different (owing to physical, developmental, and/or behavioral/emotional abnormalities) or difficult, based on temperament style.\n",
      "Finally, the environment may contain stressors that may make the caregiving less than ideal and may overextend the coping abilities of the caregiver. While exploring the role of environmental stress and caregiver frustration in the occurrence of child abuse, Straus and Kantor found a complex interaction between the amount of stress present in the family setting and the response of the caregivers.[9] Not all stressed caregivers responded by inflicting harm on the children in the environment.\n",
      "Straus and Kantor concluded that human beings have a capacity for acting violently both in and outside the family setting. Physical abuse can result if a specific home situation arises that has a relatively high degree of stress and a baseline amount of violence within it (eg, spanking the children, pushing or slapping a spouse). Thus, risk of child abuse is related to the response of caregivers whose caregiving environment has a certain amount of overall risk for violent behavior. The caregivers' level of social connectedness to nonrelatives seems to have a role to play in the children's risk for maltreatment. Caregivers under high degrees of stress who did not participate in clubs, unions, and other organizations (ie, socially isolated) had higher rates of abusing children than those who were not as socially isolated. However, children whose caregivers had many family members living nearby did not achieve the same protective effect, as did the nonfamilial social connectedness group.\n",
      "The relationship of domestic violence or intimate partner violence (IPV) and child maltreatment is receiving increasing attention. Each year, between 3.3 and 10 million children witness episodes of family violence; 30-59% of mothers of abused children are victims of domestic violence or intimate partner violence. Additionally, children whose mothers are victims of domestic violence or intimate partner violence are 6-15 times more likely to be maltreated compared to children living in families in which their mothers are not being battered. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that pediatricians assess for the presence of domestic violence and intimate partner violence in the child's family and observes that intervening on behalf of the victimized parent (typically the child's mother) may be an effective child-abuse prevention strategy.[10] Note the image below.\n",
      "The relationship between the application of corporal punishment and risk for maltreatment remains an area of concern. Corporal punishment is defined as a discipline method that uses physical force as a behavioral modifier. Corporal punishment is nearly universal; 90% of US families report having used spanking as a means of discipline at some time. Corporal punishment has its roots in personal, cultural, religious, and societal views of children and how they are to be disciplined. Corporal punishment includes pinching, spanking, paddling, shoving, slapping, shaking, hair pulling, choking, excessive exercise, confinement in closed spaces, and denial of access to a toilet.\n",
      "No credible evidence in medical literature supports the continued use of corporal punishment; spanking is less effective than \"time out\" or removal of privileges for decreasing undesired behavior in children. Discipline, however, is a necessary component for child rearing, and appropriate discipline aims for limit setting, teaching right from wrong, assisting in decision making, and helping the child develop a sense of self-control.\n",
      "When physical force is used as a discipline technique (as in corporal punishment), the concern arises that if the misconduct continues even after corporal punishment is applied, the caregiver then may become angry and frustrated and reapply the physical force. As the physical force is reapplied while the caregiver is becoming increasingly angry, the potential emerges for the caregiver to lose control and injure the child. Regardless of whether injuring the child was the intended outcome of the corporal punishment, the end result experienced by the injured child is that he or she has been hurt.\n",
      "Caregivers who use corporal punishment are often angry, irritable, depressed, fatigued, and stressed. They apply the punishment at a time that they \"have lost it,\" and caregivers frequently express remorse and agitation while punishing their children. To avoid this risk of harming the child and in order to model nonviolent behavior for children, many healthcare professionals advocate child discipline via consistent, nonphysical force based approaches such as \"time out,\" loss of privileges, expressions of parental disappointment, and grounding. Approximately one half of US pediatricians report being opposed generally to the use of corporal punishment; about one third are completely opposed to its use (about three fourths of the pediatricians reported having been spanked when they were children).\n",
      "Each form of injury sustained by a child as a result of physical abuse has its own set of biomechanics and pathophysiology. This article looks specifically at the mechanisms of injury for skeletal injury, burns, bruising, and CNS injury observed in abusive head trauma.\n",
      "Skeletal fractures are caused by the application of force to the bone. An essential step in the evaluation of injury in children is determining whether the injury being evaluated matches the history provided by the caregiver. This process requires understanding both the mechanisms and forces needed to cause specific types of fractures as well as specific characteristics of infant and childhood bone compared with adult bone.\n",
      "The child's immature skeleton is characterized by more porous/trabecular bone than in the mature bone. The less-dense porous bone tolerates more deformity than adult bone and accounts for the childhood bending and buckling injuries observed with green stick and buckle injuries. The periosteum (the fibrous membrane that covers the bone) is thicker and more easily elevated off the bone in children. The child's joint capsule and ligaments are strong and relatively more resistant to stress than the bone and cartilage, which accounts for less joint dislocations and ligamentous tears in childhood. Finally, bone healing is more rapid in children than in adults, which makes dating of childhood fractures more complicated.\n",
      "While certain types of fractures (eg posterior rib, scapular, classic metaphyseal lesions) are more common in physical abuse than accidental injury, there is no fracture that is pathognomonic for child physical abuse. All fractures must be carefully evaluated and correlated with the child's medical history and with the history given by the caregivers. Fractures can be classified by location in the body (eg skull vs long bone) and then by location in the bone (eg diaphyseal vs metaphyseal, posterior vs anterior rib). Certain fracture types are only seen in developing, immature bone (eg, greenstick, classic metaphyseal lesions, Salter-Harris fractures).\n",
      "Specifically in long bones, fractures are described based on location and type. Diaphyseal fractures are breaks in the mid shaft of the long bones. Transverse fractures typically occur if the force is applied perpendicular to the long axis of the bone. Spiral or oblique fractures occur if the force applied has a rotational component. Buckle or compression fractures occur commonly at the transition from diaphysis to metaphysis. Note the images below.\n",
      "Metaphyseal fractures (also called corner fractures or bucket handle fractures) are microfractures through the immature part of the bone edge and often appear like chips or corner fractures on radiographs. The metaphysis is an area of rapid bone turnover in the growing infant and toddler. Metaphyseal fractures are specific to infants as they involve the immature physis; they are caused by shearing and tensile stress seen in rapid acceleration and deceleration forces to the extremity.\n",
      "Skull bones may be fractured as a result of direct impact to the head with a solid surface or object. Skull fractures typically occur at the site of impact to the head, but owing to the oval shape of the head, a single point of impact may result in bilateral fractures remote from the site of impact. The skull bones differ from long bones in that they develop within a membrane and not from cartilage as do the long bones.\n",
      "Rib fractures may be observed in physical abuse as well. Rib fractures occur as a result of direct blows to the chest and via anteroposterior compression. Most abusive rib fractures are posterior, adjacent to the vertebral body, with the rib levering over the transverse process of the vertebra.\n",
      "Dating of boney injuries is particularly important in the evaluation of physical abuse, because it may assist investigators in determining who had access to the child in the period the injury is estimated to have occurred. The body of medical literature evaluating the precision of dating of fractures has evolved over the last decade. The classic teaching has been that fractured long bones and ribs heal in a predictable manner, which is divided into the following 4 stages: initial healing, soft callus, hard callus, and remodeling. Orthopedic aspects of bone healing are described in Forearm Fractures.\n",
      "This traditional description of bone healing included general timelines for the age of the injury based on the stage of healing seen at the time of injury identification. In young children, bone healing tends to occur more rapidly than in older children and adults. Newer studies of dating of fractures, however, emphasize that the classic descriptions (eg, soft callus, hard callus) are based on histiologic specimens rather than plain film readings, and significant inconsistencies exist among radiologic interpretation of healing phases.[11] The evaluation of the healing process on plain films permits some level of dating of injuries and allows the healthcare professional to distinguish new and relatively older fractures in the same child; providers should exercise caution in precisely dating fracture age based on x-ray findings alone.\n",
      "Metaphyseal fractures are generally harder to date because of the relative lack of disruption in the periosteum at the time of the fracture. Skull fractures heal differently than do long bones because of their intramembranous nature; they do not heal with a large amount of callus formation and are more difficult to date. The skills and advice of an experienced pediatric radiologist should be consulted if dating of injuries becomes central to the maltreatment investigation.\n",
      "Burns arise from the application of heat energy to the child's skin. Various sources such as hot liquids (scalds), hot objects (contact or dry), flame (flash), chemicals, and electricity can generate heat. Three concentric zones of affected tissues have been identified. Coagulation is the most direct contact with the heat source in which the skin undergoes immediate coagulation necrosis as the proteins denature, and no cellular repair is possible. Stasis involves less heat energy exposure than with coagulation, and these cells, though injured, have some potential for repair. Hyperemia is the least direct injury, and these cells have the greatest potential for repair. All of these types and depth of burns can be encountered in both inflicted and accidental burns in children.\n",
      "Human skin is composed of 3 layers: the epidermis, dermis, and subcutaneous tissue. Burns are classified clinically depending on the depth of the injury and the involvement of the various skin layers.\n",
      "Superficial burns, which injure only the uppermost tissue of the epidermis, present as red, painful areas without blisters. Complete healing is expected from superficial burns. Deeper burns that extend through the epidermis into the upper levels of the dermis are referred to as partial thickness burns and present as painful blistering areas. Healing of partial-thickness burns varies, with various degrees of scarring depending on the level of tissue that is damaged. Finally, the deepest burns, full-thickness burns, extend past the epidermis and dermis and involve the subcutaneous tissue. These burns essentially have destroyed the overlying skin, blood vessels, and associated nerves and present as white, insensitive areas because of this destruction. A high degree of scarring and disfigurement result from full-thickness burns.\n",
      "Evaluation of suspicious burns in children must include, as with any medical complaint, a detailed history from the caregiver and child, including a developmental history to ensure the child is capable of contributing to the injury (eg, \"turned on the faucet\"). Physical examination should include assessment of the burned area; critical assessment of the burned versus spared areas of skin can be helpful in determining the position of the child at the time of the burn. Note the image below.\n",
      "Careful gathering of information about what the child was wearing at the time, the time elapsed since the burn, symptom progression, and any topical treatments to the area is important in the determination of cause. Many childhood burns involve hot water in bathtubs or heated liquids in a kitchen setting. Scene investigations by child protective services and/or law enforcement can gather crucial information for determining whether the burn was inflicted or accidental burn (eg, temperature of tap water, height of faucets from floor, ease of turning handles, food residue on clothing or at the scene). Note the image below.\n",
      "Bruising occurs when blunt mechanical force is applied to the child's skin to such a degree that capillaries (and potentially larger vessels) become disrupted resulting in the leakage of blood into the subcutaneous tissue. The amount of blood and size and location of the involved area account for the appearance of the bruise. If force is applied via an object, the bruise may reflect the shape and geometry of the object.\n",
      "In general, a bruise progresses through a series of colors beginning with deep red, blue, or purple, then changes to a deep blue, then greenish, and, finally, resolves with a yellowish brown color. The various colors emanate from the breakdown of the extravascular blood into the components of hemoglobin. As the extravascular blood organizes itself and is resorbed, certain patterns of color change are expected; however, caution is advised because no clearly predictable chronology can be relied on with absolute certainty. Physicians should be cautious in offering dating information and, at most, only should suggest broad time ranges based on the clinical appearance and stages of healing of the bruise. Similar to fractures, recent data on dating of bruises indicate that color is a poor predictor of bruise age.[12] \n",
      "CNS trauma is among the most serious forms of injury that is observed in the context of physical abuse. CNS trauma may result in intracranial hemorrhage, including (1) epidural hemorrhage, which is bleeding into the space between inner skull bone surface and the dura, frequently due to a direct injury to the middle meningeal artery; (2) subdural hemorrhage, which is bleeding into the space between the inner surface of the dura and arachnoid membranes, typically caused by sheering of the bridging vessels that go from the brain surface to the dura; and (3) subarachnoid hemorrhage, which is bleeding into the space between the inner surface of the arachnoid and the brain surface.\n",
      "Other CNS injuries may include contusions (ie, direct injury to the brain tissue) and intraparenchymal bleeding (ie, bleeding directly into substance of the brain). These primary injuries can be obscured or complicated by anoxic brain injuries and swelling, which are frequently seen in complex head injury, whether accidental or inflicted.\n",
      "Discussing CNS injury and physical abuse inevitably leads to a discussion of abusive head trauma (AHT), previously referred to as shaken baby syndrome (SBS) or shaking-impact syndrome.[13] The original description of AHT (originally referred to as whiplash syndrome) describes a clinical constellation of findings classically described as subdural hematoma, retinal hemorrhage (found in 65-95% of cases), and skeletal fractures, such as metaphyseal fractures and posterior rib fractures (found in 30-70% of cases) sustained when the child is shaken violently back and forth. AHT represents a significant injury pattern in the realm of child maltreatment; although it is associated with the findings listed above, the core injury is to the brain cells themselves, resulting from the application of forces to the child's delicate and developing brain tissue.\n",
      "AHT has been extended to include cases where the child's head is impacted against a surface, either soft or hard, and may be called AHT. Diffuse, serious brain injuries result from external forces that cause the rotation of the brain about its center of gravity. Such forces exceed those generated in normal childcare activities and are different from the low velocity translational forces (straight-line movement) that commonly occur in household falls. Immense angular deceleration forces may be generated with sudden striking of the child's head against a surface; these forces act on the brain tissue and cerebral vessels and generate the deleterious effect, which is not specifically from the contact forces applied to the skull.\n",

      "United States\n",

      "It is important to understand the sources of data on child maltreatment incidence. The National Incidence Study (NIS) methodology views maltreated children who are investigated by child protective services (CPS) agencies as representing only the \"tip of the iceberg;\" thus, children investigated by CPS are included along with maltreated children who are identified by professionals in a wide range of agencies in representative communities.\n",
      "The Fourth National Incidence Study (NIS-4) uses data gathered from a nationally representative sample of 122 counties. CPS agencies in these counties provide data about all children in cases they accept for investigation during 1 of 2 reference periods (September 4, 2005 through December 3, 2005, or February 4, 2006 through May 3, 2006). Additionally, professionals in these same counties serve as NIS-4 sentinels and report data about maltreated children identified by the following organizations: elementary and secondary public schools; public health departments; public housing authorities; short-stay general and children's hospitals; state, county, and municipal police/sheriff departments; licensed daycare centers; juvenile probation departments; voluntary social services and mental health agencies; shelters for runaway and homeless youth; and shelters for victims of domestic violence.\n",
      "In 2009, approximately 3.3 million reports involving 5.9 million children were made to CPS agencies. Of these, 60.7% were accepted as needing further investigation, and, once evaluated, the investigations concluded that child abuse and neglect had affected approximately 695,000 children included in 754,000 cases of abuse (ie, some children with more than one episode of substantiated abuse), with 17.6% of this total representing cases of substantiated physical abuse. The most common form of substantiated abuse in 2009 was child neglect (including medical neglect), which accounted for 80.7% of cases, followed by child sexual abuse (9.2% of cases) and emotional maltreatment (8.1% of cases).[14] \n",
      "The NIS-4 reported that of the approximately 1.25 million estimated annual cases of child abuse, approximately 323,000 cases were identified as physical abuse.[5] The number of children who experienced physical abuse decreased from an estimated 381,700 at the time of the NIS–3 (1993) to an estimated 323,000 in the NIS–4 (a 15% decrease in number and a 23% decline in the rate).\n",
      "It is important to recognize that these numbers reflect changes in the \"Harm Standard\" as defined by NIS, which is relatively stringent in that it generally requires that an act or omission result in demonstrable harm in order to be classified as abuse or neglect.\n",
      "NIS-4 also reported on the Endangerment Standard, which includes all children who meet the Harm Standard but adds others as well. The central feature of the Endangerment Standard is that it counts children who were not yet harmed by abuse or neglect if thought that the maltreatment endangered the children or if a CPS investigation substantiated or indicated their maltreatment. In addition, the Endangerment Standard is slightly more lenient than the Harm Standard in allowing a broader array of perpetrators, including adult caretakers other than parents in certain maltreatment categories and teenage caretakers as perpetrators of sexual abuse.\n",
      "Comparing the Endangerment Standard, the number of physically abused children decreased from an estimated 614,100 children in 1993 to 476,600 in 2006 (a 22% decrease in number, a 29% decline in the rate). The reasons behind this decrease are uncertain and may be a result of sample sizes in technique. These data should not be misinterpreted as an indication that physical abuse or endangerment of children has been \"cured.\" NIS-4 data report that 1 child in every 58 in the United States was harmed under the Harm Standard definition, including physical abuse, sexual abuse, and neglect.\n",
      "In various clinical series, skeletal fractures are observed in approximately 30% of the children, burns are observed in 9-10%, bruises are quite common and are present in approximately 40% of child maltreatment cases, and inflicted CNS injury is observed in 24% of children treated for head injury.\n",
      "Finkelhor, Jones, and Shattuck have analyzed trends in reporting and substantiation rates for child abuse and neglect from the 1990s through 2010 and have identified a decline in the number of substantiated cases of physical abuse.[15] According to their most recent analysis, the incidence of substantiated physical abuse cases declined 56% from 1992-2010. Cases of child sexual abuse have also declined substantially, with a 53% decrease in the number of substantiated cases of sexual abuse observed from 1992-2006. However, child neglect, the most common form of child maltreatment, declined but less so, with a 10% decline in substantiated cases from 1992-2010. Note the image below.\n",

      "According to the NIS-4 study, an estimated 2400 children were known to have died as a result of maltreatment from 2005-2006. According to Prevent Child Abuse America's National Center on Child Abuse Prevention Research, in 2006 an estimated 1,530 were known to have died as a result of child maltreatment, which is an average of 4 children each day of the year.[16] Children aged 0-3 years accounted for 78% of the child abuse and neglect fatalities, with infants younger than 1 year accounting for 44.2% of these maltreatment-related fatalities. When looking at the types of maltreatment that accounted for the fatalities, the breakdown is as follows:\n",
      "Child neglect - 43%\n",
      "Multiple forms of maltreatment - 31.4%\n",
      "Physical abuse - 22.4%\n",

      "\n",
      "Morbidity\n",
      "\n",
      "Different forms of injury have different risks. For example, CNS injury and occult abdominal injury in younger children are particularly serious. Bruises may be superficial or harbingers of more serious deeper injury. Burns observed in child maltreatment cases tend to be highly severe. Finally, skeletal injuries may be isolated or multiple in nature and may be associated with other injuries. DiScala and colleagues conducted a 10-year retrospective of medical records in the National Pediatric Trauma Registry (NPTR) from 1988-1997; it compared hospitalized, injured children younger than 5 years to determine differences between inflicted (n= 1,997) and accidental injuries (n= 16,831).[17] \n",
      "DiScala's group found that compared with children who had accidental injury, children who were abused tended to be younger (12.8 mo vs 25.5 mo), were mainly injured by battering (53%) and shaking (10.3%), and were more likely to have a preinjury medical history of a medical problem or condition. The unintentionally injured children were mainly injured by falls (58.4%) and motor vehicles (37.1%). Note the image below.\n",
      "In order to fully comprehend the morbidity of victims of child abuse victims, it is necessary to look beyond the immediate period of injury and recovery. Looking at potential long-term impacts on health and well being, Felitti et al explored the connection between exposure to childhood abuse and the connection between household dysfunction to subsequent health risks and the development of illness in adulthood in a series of studies referred to as the Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) studies.[18] Of 13,494 adults who completed a standard medical evaluation in 1995-1996, 9,508 completed a survey questionnaire that asked about their own childhood abuse and exposure to household dysfunction; the investigators then made correlations to risk factors and disease conditions.\n",
      "In order to assess exposure to child abuse and neglect, the ACE questionnaire asked about categories of child maltreatment, specifically psychological, physical, and sexual maltreatment. When asking about physical abuse, the questionnaire asked the patients if a parent or other adult in the household had (1) often or very often pushed, grabbed, shoved, or slapped them or (2) often or very often hit them so hard that marks or other injuries resulted.\n",
      "In order to assess exposure to household dysfunction, the ACE questionnaire asked questions by category of dysfunction, such as having a household member who had problems with substance abuse (eg, problem drinker, drug user), mental illness (eg, psychiatric problem), criminal behavior in household (eg, incarceration) or having a mother who was treated violently. In assessing if their mother was treated violently when the patient was a child, respondents were asked if their mother or step-mother was (1) sometimes or very often pushed, grabbed, slapped, bitten, hit with a fist, or hit with something hard or had something thrown at her or (2) was ever repeatedly hit for at least a few minutes or threatened with or hurt by a knife or gun.\n",
      "In addition to the questionnaire information, the standardized medical examination of the adults assessed risk factors and actual disease conditions. The risk factors included smoking, severe obesity, physical inactivity, depressed mood, suicide attempts, alcoholism, any drug abuse, a high lifetime number of sexual partners, and a history of sexually transmitted disease (STD). The disease conditions included ischemic heart disease, cancer, stroke, chronic bronchitis, emphysema, diabetes, hepatitis, and skeletal fractures.\n",
      "Once all the data were collected and analyzed, Felitti et al found that the most prevalent ACE was substance abuse (25.6%), the least prevalent ACE was criminal behavior (3.4%), and the prevalence of physical abuse was 10.8% and the prevalence of the mother being treated violently was 12.5%.\n",
      "Overall, 52% of the respondents had one or more ACEs and 6.2% had 4 or more ACEs. The following were findings in respondents who experienced 4 or more ACEs compared with those who had none:\n",
      "Risk of alcoholism, drug abuse, depression, and suicide attempt increased 4-12 fold\n",
      "Rates of smoking, poor self-rated health, and high number of sexual partners and STDs increased 2-4 fold\n",
      "Physical inactivity and severe obesity increased 1.4-1.6 fold\n",
      "The major finding of the ACE studies was a graded relationship between the number of exposures to maltreatment and household dysfunction during childhood to the presence in later life of multiple risk factors and several disease conditions associated with death in adulthood. Note the image below.\n",
      "Bentley and Widom (2009) found that physical abuse during childhood is a risk factor for obesity in adulthood. In a prospective assessment comparing individuals with documented histories of childhood physical and sexual abuse and neglect with a matched cohort of children without such histories, 30-year follow-up showed that childhood physical abuse led to significantly higher body mass index (BMI) scores in adulthood (beta = 0.14, P < 0.05), even controlling for demographic characteristics, cigarette smoking, and alcohol consumption (beta = 0.16, P < 0.01). In contrast, childhood sexual abuse or neglect was not a significant predictor of adult BMI scores.[19] \n",
      "No significant difference in incidence of physical abuse was noted based on race in both the 1993 NIS-3 and the 1986 NIS-2. In Child Maltreatment 2010, a specific breakdown for physical abuse was not provided; however, overall racial information for all cases of abuse is as follows: African American (1221.9%), American Indian/Alaskan Native (1.1%), Asian (0.9%), Pacific Islander (0.2%), white (44.8%), multiple racial affiliations (3.5%), Hispanic (21.4%), and unknown/missing information (6.3%).[14] \n",
      "NIS-4 compared 3 major categories of white (non-Hispanic), black (non-Hispanic), and Hispanic and found that white and black children differed significantly in their rates of experiencing overall Harm Standard abuse during the 2005–2006 NIS-4 study year. An estimated 10.4 cases per 1,000 black children suffered Harm Standard abuse during the NIS-44 study year, compared with 6 cases per 1,000 white children and 6.7 cases per 1,000 Hispanic children. The abuse rate of black children is 1.7 times that of white children and 1.6 times that of Hispanic children.\n",
      "NIS-4 found no significant difference between boys’ and girls’ rates of experiencing serious harm under the Harm Standard. Since the 1006 NIS-3 data, the incidence rates for both sexes declined, but the boys’ rate declined more than that of girls; the boys’ rate declined by 33%, whereas the girls’ rate declined by just 11%.\n",
      "A specific sex-based breakdown is not provided in Child Maltreatment 2010; however, the overall incidence of child maltreatment was not markedly different in aggregate, with boys accounting for 48.5% and girls accounting for 51.2%.\n",
      "The NIS-4 incidence of Harm Standard physical abuse is significantly lower for the youngest children (2.5 cases per 1,000 children aged 0-2 y) compared with children aged 6-14 years (4.6 cases per 1,000 or higher). The fairly low incidence rates for children younger than 2 years may reflect a detection problem; because children who are younger than school age are less observable to community professionals, their abuse may avoid detection.\n",
      "In Child Maltreatment 2010, a specific breakdown was not provided for physical abuse; however, the overall unique count for substantiated cases by age was as follows: 1-3 years (34.0%), 4-7 years (23.4%), 8-11 years (18.7%), 12-15 years (17.3%), and 16-17 years (6.2%). Children younger than 1 year had the highest rate of victimization overall, at 20.6% per 1,000 children in the population of the same age.[14] \n",
      "Childhood is a time of accidental injuries. Understanding the developmental level and abilities of the child is essential in determining if the history provided by the parent or caregiver is a possible or plausible explanation for the child's injury. Once the full extent of the injury is determined based on physical examination, radiology, and laboratory workup, the healthcare provider can further assess the plausibility of the explanation offered by the parent or caregiver. A history that is implausible based on what a child at that level is capable of doing should raise a high degree of concern for possible maltreatment.\n",
      "Whenever a child is injured, a complete history of the circumstances surrounding the injury, as well as a detailed injury history, is essential. Basic questions include the following:\n",
      "When was the child last 100% well?\n",
      "What was the date and time of the injury and when was it first noted?\n",
      "Where did the injury occur?\n",
      "Who witnessed the injury?\n",
      "What was happening prior to the injury?\n",
      "What did the child do after the injury?\n",
      "What did the caregiver do after the injury?\n",
      "How long after the injury did the caregiver wait until seeking care for the child?\n",
      "What symptoms was the child exhibiting, and what, if any, remedies did the caregiver attempt?\n",
      "Inquire about specific details related to the injury, such as height of the fall, landing surface, and temperature of water (if scald burn), among others.\n",
      "The past medical history should be explored for general health and previous trauma and hospitalizations, as well as for the source of healthcare and developmental and social aspects of the child's life. In cases of maltreatment, the history is often inaccurate and misleading. The following historical elements should raise concerns for possible physical abuse:\n",
      "Details change, or additional scenarios are suggested, as additional trauma is identified or as the cause of the trauma is questioned\n",
      "Details are inconsistent among caregivers\n",
      "Caregivers give implausible details not congruent with the trauma observed on examination\n",
      "Caregivers describe minor trauma, but the child displays major injury on examination\n",
      "No history of trauma is offered\n",
      "Injury described as self-inflicted is not possible given the age/developmental abilities of the child\n",
      "Caregivers demonstrate a significant delay in seeking treatment for the child\n",
      "Serious injury is blamed on a younger sibling/playmate\n",
      "Caregiver frequently changes healthcare facilities, pediatricians, or emergency departments\n",
      "Physical examination of the child with an injury obviously is important, and the order of the complete examination is determined by the presenting condition of the child. Children with less severe injuries in stable condition can have the injured area examined last, since that area is most likely to be uncomfortable. Severely injured children in critical condition require life saving measures first, following the standards of care for trauma life-support; other components of the examination follow from that point.\n",
      "Because physical abuse is often an ongoing pattern of unsafe care,[20, 21] performing a thorough head-to-toe examination is essential in order to find other areas of either current or previous injury. Physical indicators that should raise suspicion for maltreatment include the following:\n",
      "Injury pattern inconsistent with the history provided\n",
      "Multiple injuries/multiple types of injuries\n",
      "Injuries at various stages of healing\n",
      "Poor hygiene\n",
      "Presence of pathognomonic injuries including loop marks; forced immersion burn pattern; and classic abusive head trauma findings of subdural hematoma, retina hemorrhage, and skeletal injuries\n",
      "Bruising over bony prominences is common in childhood, but patterns of bruising that raise the concern of possible abuse include the following:\n",
      "Involvement of multiple areas of the body beyond bony prominences\n",
      "Bruising of ears, facial cheeks, buttocks, palms, soles, neck, genitals (see images below)\n",
      "Bruises at many stages of healing (see Bruising, in Pathophysiology)\n",
      "Bruises in nonambulatory child\n",
      "Patterned markings resembling objects, grab marks, slap marks, human bites, and loop marks (see images below)\n",
      "Oral injury, lingular or labial frenula tears\n",
      "Skeletal injuries in children younger than 2 years may not be obvious; therefore, a skeletal survey screening is recommended (see Workup for the components of the skeletal survey).[22, 23] Many fracture types can be accidental or inflicted. Fractures that raise a high degree of suspicion for inflicted injury include the following:\n",
      "ANY fracture in a nonambulatory infant without clear accidental and consistent mechanism\n",
      "Metaphyseal fractures\n",
      "Multiple, bilateral, differently aged posterior rib fractures (see image below)\n",
      "Multiple and complex skull fractures if only simple impact history\n",
      "Spinous process fractures\n",
      "Scapular fractures\n",
      "Burn patterns that may suggest physical maltreatment include the following:\n",
      "Patterned contact burns in clear shape of hot object (eg, fork, clothing iron, curling iron, cigarette lighter) (see image below)\n",
      "Classic forced immersion burn pattern with sharp stocking-and-glove demarcation and sparing of flexed protected areas\n",
      "Splash/spill burn patterns not consistent with history or developmental level\n",
      "Cigarette burns\n",
      "Bilateral or mirror image burns\n",
      "Localized burns to genitals, buttocks, and perineum (especially at toilet training stage)\n",
      "Evidence for excessive delay in seeking treatment, and the presence of other forms of injury\n",
      "No one single cause has been identified that explains the occurrence of all cases of physical abuse.\n",
      "Determining whether an injury was inflicted by a caregiver or caused by accidental means is more than a medical determination, and the current and future safety and well being of the child and family are at stake. Many medical conditions may mimic some of the findings observed in physical abuse, and the differential diagnoses to consider differ depending on the types of physical, laboratory, and radiographic findings observed. Differential diagnoses should be worked through carefully in cases of suspected inflicted injury so that suspected physical abuse can be diagnosed confidently and caregivers are not inappropriately accused of abuse.\n",
      "In all injuries, the major differential diagnosis is between accidental and inflicted injury. Determination of accident versus abuse is best accomplished by pairing thoughtful, thorough medical evaluation with information gathered through a multidisciplinary investigation, often involving child protective services (CPS) and law enforcement agencies.\n",
      "Child physical abuse guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) were updated in 2015 and include new information on the lasting effects of abuse and highlight risk factors for abuse and abusive injuries that are frequently overlooked.[24, 25] \n",
      "Bruises\n",
      "For bruises, the differential diagnoses include the following:\n",
      "Mongolian spots (collection of melanocytes producing a bluish color present at birth in 80% of black children and in many other ethnicities); see images below\n",
      "Hemangiomas (overgrowth of capillaries)\n",
      "Eczema\n",
      "Phytophotodermatitis (cutaneous phototoxic cutaneous eruption)\n",
      "Erythema multiforme (multishaped red lesions believed to be a sensitivity reaction)\n",
      "Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP)\n",
      "Bleeding disorders (eg, hemophilia)\n",
      "Malignancy\n",
      "Ehlers-Danlos syndrome\n",
      "Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) type I\n",
      "Folk-healing practices (eg, coining, cupping; see Burns, below)\n",
      "Skeletal fractures\n",
      "For skeletal fractures, the differential diagnoses include normal variants of bone structure (may appear as suspicious findings on radiographs), congenital syphilis (leads to periosteal elevation), rickets or other mineralization deficits (cause bone fragility), and OI. OI is frequently raised as a possibility in cases of an unexplained fracture and possible physical abuse. Four types of OI are recognized, as follows:\n",
      "Type I is the most common form, has autosomal dominant inheritance, and is responsible for 80% of patients. Other major findings of type I OI include mildly to moderately severe bone fragility with occasional fractures at birth, easy bruising, short stature, and blue sclera. Type I OI may be associated with a family history of hearing impairment. Type I may easily be confused with maltreatment, especially if all of the injuries are skeletal in nature. A thorough medical history and family history are essential.\n",
      "Type II is a perinatal lethal form. Death typically occurs by age 1 month, with multiple fractures at birth. This type of OI is generally readily distinguishable from child physical abuse.\n",
      "Type III is rare and is easily distinguished from maltreatment because of severe bone fragility and osteopenia, triangular facies, ligamentous laxity, skeletal deformity, and abnormal appearance of teeth.\n",
      "Type IV is the most difficult to distinguish from maltreatment because bones may appear normal when the first fracture develops but are usually characterized by mild-to-moderate bone fragility, osteopenia, wormian bones, birth fractures in approximately one third of cases, and normal sclerae. Genetic consultation is necessary to pursue a more detailed workup for OI and the characterization of the collagen disorder.\n",
      "The incidence of OI (all types) is estimated at 1 case in 20,000 live births; OI is much rarer than child abuse.\n",
      "Burns\n",
      "The differential diagnoses for lesions that appear as burns include, but is not limited to, hypersensitivity reaction with blistering, friction blisters, impetigo (may appear circular and be confused with cigarette burns), phytophotodermatitis (reddened areas and erosions that result from sun exposure of skin that has psoralen residue), dermatitis herpetiformis (immunobullous skin condition characterized by blisters that may erode), and folk-healing practices such as coining (rubbing of coin or spoon repetitively over the skin), cupping (application of heated cup over skin with resultant vacuum action as it cools), and moxibustion (application of heated incense to skin). The physician should look for a history supporting this diagnosis over a diagnosis of suspected physical abuse.\n",
      "CNS injuries\n",
      "The differential diagnoses for the altered mental status findings observed in CNS injuries include various serious disorders such as meningitis, neurologic conditions that have seizures as a component, and ingestions that may simulate the serious clinical features of CNS injury.\n",
      "A child with CNS injury often is seriously ill, presenting in a life-threatening condition with seizures and respiratory arrest. For serious life-threatening injury, no data support the existence of a lucid period between the time of injury and the onset of symptoms; rather, for acute subdural hematoma with severe neurologic sequela, clinical deterioration would be expected immediately around the time of injury. Traumatic acute subdural hematomas, especially those that lead to the death of child, do not occur in a subclinical or insidious manner in an otherwise healthy infant.\n",
      "Abusive head trauma (AHT)\n",
      "In considering the differential diagnoses for the findings in AHT, the differential diagnosis subdural hematoma and retinal hemorrhages needs to be considered. For subdural hematoma, the differential diagnoses include accidental trauma, coagulation disorders, vascular malformations, the rare amino acid inborn error of metabolism glutaric aciduria type I (associated with acute encephalopathy and chronic subdural hematoma), and the folk-healing practice caida di mollera, in which a child with a sunken fontanel is inverted, held upside down by the ankles, and shaken.\n",
      "Retinal hemorrhages\n",
      "For retinal hemorrhages, the differential diagnoses include vasculitis, vascular obstruction, and toxic febrile states associated with serious infection. Again, in working through a differential diagnoses, the workup should reveal history and physical examination findings supportive of such a diagnosis over physical abuse.\n",
      "History and the physical examination findings determine which laboratory and diagnostic imaging studies are necessary.[1] \n",
      "If a bleeding problem is suspected, a basic bleeding evaluation (platelets, PT, aPTT) is a valuable screening tool, the results of which may suggest the need for more sophisticated bleeding evaluation and/or hematology consultation, if available. Pattern mark or highly suspicious bruising, in the absence of other bruising in more common locations (eg, shins of school-age child), likely does not require an extensive bleeding workup.\n",
      "If a genetic bone disease or mineralization defect is suspected, screening calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, and vitamin D levels is indicated. Interpretation of vitamin D levels in children is complex due to lack of robust evidence establishing normal values and thresholds below which bones would be clinically more susceptible to fracture. Review of radiographs with a pediatric radiologist is ideal to evaluate bones for signs of poor growth or healing. Genetic consultation, if available, may be warranted.\n",
      "Toxicology screening is indicated if the clinical situation suggests a possible ingestion as the cause of the findings on examination and evaluation or when a child presents from a household where drug use or production is suspected or confirmed.[2] \n",
      "Screening for abdominal injury is recommended in children younger than age 5 years in whom abuse is suspected, even in the absence of clear external evidence of abdominal injury or symptoms such as pain or vomiting. Note the image below.\n",
      "Screening includes aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) as markers for liver injury, amylase and lipase levels for pancreatic injury, urine analysis for red blood cells to evaluate for urinary tract injury, and stool guaiac for intestinal injury.[3, 4] \n",
      "Basic guidelines for the appropriate evaluation of a child suspected to be a victim of physical abuse, by age, are shown below.\n",
      "For children younger than 2 years suspected of having been physically abused, a skeletal survey is recommended to rule out skeletal injury, both new and old. A retrospective study on children assessed with skeletal surveys to evaluate for missed physical abuse and unsuspected fractures found that about 11% of the survey results were positive for a previously unsuspected fracture. The skeletal survey results directly influenced making the diagnosis of abuse in 50% of the children with positive skeletal survey results. Wider use of skeletal survey may be justified, especially for high-risk populations.[26] \n",
      "In 2014, a multispecialty panel of experts released skeletal survey guidelines to help guide assessment of whether fractures in children under 2 years of age are due to abuse or accidents.[22, 23] Recommendations include the following:\n",
      "Skeletal survey should be performed in children with fractures resulting from abuse, domestic violence, or being hit by a toy or other object.\n",
      "Skeletal survey should be performed in children with rib fractures and in those without a history of fracture from trauma, except in ambulatory children 12 months of age or older with a toddler fracture or buckle fracture of the radius/ulna or tibia/fibula.\n",
      "If no abuse is suspected, skeletal survey should not be performed in cases of distal spiral fracture of the tibia/fibula in children 12-23 months old with a history of falling while running/walking, or in cases of distal radial/ulna buckle fracture in ambulatory children 12-23 months old with a history of falling onto an outstretched hand.\n",
      "Skeletal survey should be performed in most children under 12 months of age.\n",
      "Depending on history and physical examination, other diagnostic and imaging tests may be indicated including the following:\n",
      "Radionuclide bone scanning assists in identifying new rib fractures and subtle long bone fractures not apparent on the skeletal survey.\n",
      "CT scanning of the head is indicated in any child suspected of inflicted head trauma in order to image the brain and assess for injury (see guidelines in image below)\n",
      "MRI can be a valuable adjunct to head CT scanning because it can further define an injury and help identify different ages of blood contained in a subdural hematoma\n",
      "CT scanning of the thorax and abdomen may be helpful to view the organs in the chest and abdomen if injury is suspected. CT scanning of the abdomen is recommended in suspected abuse victims who have abnormal values for AST, ALT, amylase, lipase, or urine red blood cells, as indicated in Lab Studies. Note the images below.\n",
      "Photodocumentation of cutaneous injuries, such as burns, bite marks, bruising, or other injuries, is very helpful in cases of child abuse. Photodocumentation, when used as an adjunct to standard medical written documentation, allows consulting physicians, child protective services (CPS) workers, law enforcement personnel, attorneys, and others to view and better comprehend the injuries. Photographs of injuries are very helpful in legal proceedings for protecting the child and determining guilt. Photodocumentation should be performed in accordance with institutional policies and procedures and should be treated as protected health information under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).\n",
      "Treatment for physical abuse is a complex endeavor involving an interdisciplinary team approach. The nature of the injury determines the form of medical therapy, and the details of the caregiving environment determine the psychosocial supports needed to keep the child safe.\n",
      "For medical issues, skeletal fractures of the long bones may require casting, and orthopedics should be consulted for assistance with diagnosis and management.\n",
      "If clinical consideration is being given to the possibility of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), a genetics consultation may also be valuable.\n",
      "Burns vary in severity and treatments range from cleansing the area to skin grafting. Plastic surgery should be consulted for assistance with management of more serious burns; transfer to a burn unit may be indicated. See Initial Evaluation and Management of the Burn Patient for burn management.\n",
      "The most severely injured children, such as those with CNS injury, may require resuscitation and will need intensive care. A multitude of specialists may need to be involved in order to correctly evaluate and treat these seriously ill children. Whenever abusive head trauma is suspected, ophthalmology should be consulted for a formal evaluation, including examination of the eyes for retinal hemorrhages.\n",
      "Psychosocial management that requires a significant amount of coordination among various services providers, including the physician and other healthcare providers, complements the medical management. Recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics state that pediatricians are mandated reporters of suspected abuse, and reports to child protective service agencies are required by law when the physician has a reasonable suspicion of abuse. Transferring a child’s care to another physician or hospital does not relieve the pediatrician of his or her reporting responsibilities. In addition, thorough documentation in medical records and effective communication with nonmedical investigators in child protection may improve outcomes of investigations and protect vulnerable children.[24, 25] \n",
      "The child protective services (CPS) agency in each community is responsible for performing investigations of cases in which physical abuse is suspected and relies on the physicians to provide the details of the medical evaluation. In addition, CPS assesses the caregivers' background, caregiving abilities and potential, environmental safety, risk for repeat abuse, and risk to other siblings. A variety of CPS service plan options are available, ranging from periodic contact with the child and family to removal of the child from the home, either temporarily or permanently, with termination of parental rights. The CPS process for child maltreatment cases typically involves the following steps:\n",
      "Intake - Screening of reports and acceptance of case\n",
      "Initial risk assessment - Caregiver interviews, medical information gathering, home evaluation, and possibility of contact with law enforcement\n",
      "Case planning - Determination of safety for the child with essentially 3 options: (1) the child goes home with the caregiver with or without services depending on the circumstances, (2) the child is removed from home and family with caregivers' consent and offered services to assist them in working towards reunifying with the child, and (3) the child is removed from the home and family without caregivers' consent, involving court action and incorporation of legal steps and processes to determine the ultimate plan for the child.\n",
      "In cases of severe or multisystem trauma, involvement of a pediatric surgeon may be necessary for care and surgical treatment of injuries.\n",
      "The following consultations may be warranted:\n",
      "Pediatric radiologist expertise is important because many abusive fractures in infants are subtle on radiographs. Routine pediatric radiologist involvement is ideal. In locations where pediatric radiologists are not routinely available, one should be consulted in cases in which dating of bone injuries become central to the maltreatment investigation and when concerns arise regarding osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) or other bone mineralization problems.\n",
      "Orthopedists can assist with diagnosis and management in cases of skeletal fractures of the long bones.\n",
      "Hematologists can assist with diagnosis and management of bleeding disorders.\n",
      "Geneticists may be needed for a detailed workup for OI or other collagen disorders for characterization of the collagen disorder.\n",
      "Plastic surgeons may be needed to assist with the management of serious burns.\n",
      "Ophthalmologists should be involved whenever abusive head trauma (AHT) is suspected, for a formal evaluation including examination of the eyes for retinal hemorrhages via dilated direct ophthalmoscope examination, ideally with retinal photography to allow for independent peer review.\n",
      "Child psychiatrist, behavioral-developmental pediatrician, or psychiatric social worker may be needed to assess the mental health needs of the child and family, as well as to coordinate an overall psychosocial treatment plan.\n",
      "For patient education resources, see the Children's Health Center, as well as Child Abuse and Bruises.\n",

      "Gaucher disease is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the deposition of glucocerebroside in cells of the macrophage-monocyte system. The disorder results from the deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase.\n",
      "The oral glucosylceramide (glucocerebroside) synthase inhibitor eliglustat, approved by the FDA for treatment of Gaucher disease type 1 (GD1) in August 2014, has proven as effective as intravenous enzyme replacement therapy with imiglucerase.[1] \n",
      "In a study of 159 patients with Gaucher’s disease, researchers found that fewer patients treated with eliglustat (85%) than imiglucerase (94%) met criteria for hemoglobin level, platelet count, spleen volume, and liver volume indicating stable disease for 12 months. Adverse events were more common with eliglustat, but most were mild. \n",
      "In three other studies, eliglustat was superior to placebo over nine months of treatment, outcomes were similar for patients treated with eliglustat or imiglucerase for 4 years, and outcomes of eliglustat treatment were similar when dosing regimens were determined based on CYP2D6-genotype-predicted phenotype or plasma eliglustat concentrations.\n",
      "Gaucher disease has traditionally been divided into the following three clinical subtypes, delineated by the absence or presence of neurologic involvement and its progression:\n",
      "Type 1 - Nonneuronopathic form\n",
      "Type 2 - Acute neuronopathic form\n",
      "Type 3 - Chronic neuronopathic form\n",
      "Patients with type 1 disease commonly present with painless splenomegaly, anemia, or thrombocytopenia. They may also have chronic fatigue, hepatomegaly (with or without abnormal liver function test findings), bone pain, or pathologic fractures and may bruise easily because of thrombocytopenia. Bleeding secondary to thrombocytopenia may manifest as nosebleeds, bruising, or both.\n",
      "Patients with type 2 disease may present at birth or during infancy with increased tone, seizures, strabismus, and organomegaly. Failure to thrive, swallowing abnormalities, oculomotor apraxia, hepatosplenomegaly, and stridor due to laryngospasm are typical in infants with type 2 disease.\n",
      "In addition to organomegaly and bony involvement, individuals with type 3 disease have neurologic involvement.\n",
      "See Clinical Presentation for more detail.\n",
      "Diagnosis can be confirmed through measurement of glucocerebrosidase activity in peripheral blood leukocytes. A finding of less than 15% of mean normal activity is diagnostic. Minor elevations of liver and angiotensin-converting enzyme levels are common. \n",
      "See Workup for more detail.\n",
      "Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is indicated for patients with type 1 Gaucher disease who exhibit clinical signs and symptoms of the disease, including anemia, thrombocytopenia, skeletal disease, or visceromegaly. An oral glucosylceramide inhibitor is an alternate efficacious therapy.\n",
      "See Treatment and Medication for more detail. \n",
      "Gaucher disease is a lipid storage disease characterized by the deposition of glucocerebroside in cells of the macrophage-monocyte system. The disorder results from the deficiency of a specific lysosomal hydrolase, glucocerebrosidase (also termed acid beta-glucosidase, glucosylceramidase). The disease is characterized by a continuum of phenotypes. The severity widely varies; some patients present in childhood with virtually all the complications of Gaucher disease, whereas others remain asymptomatic into the eighth decade of life. \n",
      "Gaucher disease has traditionally been divided into the following 3 clinical subtypes, delineated by the absence or presence of neurologic involvement and its progression: \n",
      "Type 1 - Nonneuronopathic form\n",
      "Type 2 - Acute neuronopathic form\n",
      "Type 3 - Chronic neuronopathic form\n",
      "However, some cases do not fit precisely into one of these categories. All forms of Gaucher disease are autosomal recessively inherited. \n",
      "Type 1 Gaucher disease is more common among individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, although all 3 types are panethnic in their distribution. \n",
      "Glucosylceramide, the accumulated glycolipid, is primarily derived from the phagocytosis and degradation of senescent leukocytes and, to a lesser extent, from erythrocyte membranes. The glycolipid storage gives rise to the characteristic Gaucher cells, macrophages engorged with lipid with a crumpled–tissue-paper appearance and displaced nuclei. The factors that contribute to neurologic involvement in patients with types 2 and 3 disease are still unknown but may be related to the accumulation of a cytotoxic glycolipid, glucosylsphingosine, in the brain due to the severe deficiency of glucocerebrosidase activity or to neuroinflammation.[2] \n",
      "Glucosylceramide accumulation in the bone marrow, liver, spleen, lungs, and other organs contributes to pancytopenia, massive hepatosplenomegaly, and, at times, diffuse infiltrative pulmonary disease. Progressive infiltration of Gaucher cells in the bone marrow may lead to thinning of the cortex, pathologic fractures, bone pain, bony infarcts, and osteopenia. These bony features may also be related to macrophage-produced cytokines. \n",
      "Disruption of the ceramide-to-glucosylceramide ratio can affect barrier formation in the epidermal layer of the skin, leading to ichthyosis or a collodion skin presentation in individuals who are severely affected (those with type 2). \n",
      "\n",
      "United States\n",
      "\n",
      "Type 1 Gaucher disease more common among Jewish people of Eastern European origin; the carrier frequency in these individuals is approximately 1 per 15 population, whereas the disease frequency is 1 per 855 population. Gaucher disease is rare in the non-Jewish population, with an estimated frequency of 1 per 40,000 population. \n",
      "\n",
      "International\n",
      "\n",
      "International disease frequency is similar to that in the United States, except for areas of the world with large Ashkenazi Jewish populations. Most patients worldwide are non-Jewish. As many as 60% of patients of Ashkenazi origin are estimated to be homozygous for the mild N370S mutation, which accounts for 75% of disease alleles in this population. Many individuals with this genotype never seek medical attention, contributing to an underestimation of the disease frequency. Type 3 disease is more common in the Norrbottnian region of Sweden (1 per 50,000 population), which has been traced to a common founder in the 17th century. \n",
      "Mortality and morbidity varies with the different types.[3] \n",
      "Type 1 Gaucher disease often presents in childhood with hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia, and skeletal disease, although striking clinical variability occurs in disease severity. \n",
      "Type 2 Gaucher disease causes rapidly progressive neurovisceral storage disease and death during infancy or during the first years of life. A subset of this type, associated with congenital ichthyosis and hydrops fetalis, is described as neonatal lethal and results in perinatal or in utero death. \n",
      "Type 3 Gaucher disease is often a less rapidly progressive neurovisceral storage disease. Various associated clinical courses have been reported, some of which cause death in childhood or early adulthood. \n",
      "All forms of Gaucher disease are panethnic. Type 1 Gaucher disease is the most common lysosomal storage disease and is the most prevalent genetic disorder in individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. Type 3 disease is more common in the Norrbottnian region of Sweden. \n",
      "All 3 types of Gaucher disease are inherited as autosomal recessive traits and have an equal sex distribution.\n",
      "Patients with type 1 Gaucher disease may present in childhood with hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia, and crippling skeletal disease. Some patients are not diagnosed until adulthood, when they present with low blood counts or bone involvement, whereas others are diagnosed in the seventh to ninth decades of life after an incidental finding of thrombocytopenia or splenomegaly. Many affected individuals never develop signs or symptoms and do not seek medical attention. Types 2 and 3 Gaucher disease typically present in early childhood. Some subjects with parkinsonism have been found to have Gaucher disease at a later age. \n",
      "Because Gaucher disease is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait, the proband is commonly the first affected individual in the family. \n",
      "At onset, patients with type 1 Gaucher disease commonly present with painless splenomegaly, anemia, or thrombocytopenia. They may also have chronic fatigue, hepatomegaly (with or without abnormal liver function test findings), bone pain, or pathologic fractures and may bruise easily because of thrombocytopenia. Bleeding secondary to thrombocytopenia may manifest as nosebleeds, bruising, or both.\n",
      "In symptomatic patients, splenomegaly is progressive and can become massive. Children with massive splenomegaly may be short in stature because of the energy expenditure required by the enlarged organ.\n",
      "Most patients with type 1 Gaucher disease have radiologic evidence of skeletal involvement, including an Erlenmeyer flask deformity of the distal femur, which is an early skeletal change. Clinically apparent bony involvement, which occurs in more than 20% of patients with Gaucher disease, can present as bone pain or pathologic fractures. In patients with symptomatic bone disease, lytic lesions can develop in the long bones, ribs, and pelvis, and osteosclerosis or osteopenia may be evident at an early age. Bone crises with severe pain and swelling can occur in individuals with type 1 Gaucher disease and are frequently mistaken for synovitis or osteomyelitis until other symptoms become apparent.\n",
      "Occasional patients with type 1 Gaucher disease develop pulmonary involvement, parkinsonism, multiple myeloma, or portal hypertension. \n",
      "Patients with milder presentations of Gaucher disease are diagnosed later in life during evaluations for hematologic or skeletal problems or are found to have splenomegaly during routine examinations. Some patients are overtly asymptomatic, and a diagnosis is made incidentally after evaluation for other medical problems. \n",
      "Type 2 disease is rare and is characterized by a rapid neurodegenerative course with extensive visceral involvement and death within the first 2 years of life.\n",
      "Patients with this type may present at birth or during infancy with increased tone, seizures, strabismus, and organomegaly. Disruption of the epidermal layers of the skin, observed on skin biopsy findings, may manifest before the onset of neurological symptoms, but this may not always be clinically apparent.\n",
      "Failure to thrive, swallowing abnormalities, oculomotor apraxia, hepatosplenomegaly, and stridor due to laryngospasm are typical in infants with type 2 disease.\n",
      "The progressive psychomotor degeneration and brain stem involvement leads to death, usually caused by aspiration and respiratory compromise. \n",
      "A severe neonatal form can present in utero or perinatally with hydrops fetalis, congenital ichthyosis, or both.\n",
      "This form of Gaucher disease widely varies and can present in infancy or childhood.\n",
      "In addition to organomegaly and bony involvement, individuals with type 3 disease have neurologic involvement.\n",
      "The slowing of the horizontal saccades, an oculomotor finding, is often the sole neurologic manifestation. Some patients develop myoclonic epilepsy, exhibit learning disabilities, or develop dementia.\n",
      "One rare subgroup of patients with type 3 Gaucher disease present with oculomotor findings, calcifications of the mitral and aortic valves, and corneal opacities. The phenotype is associated with homozygosity for the D409H mutant allele.\n",
      "Another rare subgroup of patients with type 3 Gaucher disease is a genetic isolate from the Norrbottnian region of Sweden, homozygous for the L444P mutation. These individuals present in early childhood with visceral and skeletal involvement and oculomotor abnormalities and may develop seizures, cognitive disabilities, and dementia. \n",
      "Some specific learning disabilities are common in children with type 3 Gaucher disease.\n",
      "Some patients present with severe neurovisceral manifestations in infancy or early childhood but survive past the second year of life, with death occurring in mid childhood (age 3-7 y). These patients are considered to fall within the phenotypic continuum between types 2 and 3. \n",
      "Physical examination findings in type 1 disease usually include hepatosplenomegaly. Splenomegaly may be dramatic, with the splenic tip extending to the pelvis. Bruising along the anterior aspect of the shins and petechiae may be evident in patients with thrombocytopenia. Short stature and wasting are occasionally found in patients with massive organomegaly. In addition to these findings, patients with types 2 and 3 disease may have developmental delay, oculomotor abnormalities, and abnormal neurologic examinations.\n",
      "Patients present with highly variable degrees of splenomegaly, with a size increase that ranges from 5-fold to more than 80-fold when adjusted for body weight (average spleen is approximately 0.2% of body weight). The absolute size of the spleen has been known to vary between 300 g to more than 10 kg, accounting for up to 25% of body weight.\n",
      "Enlargement of the spleen appears to be most rapid in children with Gaucher disease. Rapid enlargement of the spleen in an adult with the disease should prompt suspicion of an associated disorder that may increase glycolipid turnover, such as hematologic malignancy, immune thrombocytopenia, or autoimmune hemolytic anemia. \n",
      "Nodules on the surface of the spleen may represent regions of extramedullary hematopoiesis, collections of Gaucher cells, or resolving infarcts. Evidence of old infarcts is common in spleens that are enlarged more than 20-fold. Most splenic infarcts are asymptomatic, but subcapsular infarcts can present as localized abdominal pain. Intracapsular bleeding may also occur. \n",
      "Hepatomegaly occurs in more than 50% of patients with type 1 Gaucher disease. In a series of 88 patients, liver volumes ranged from within the reference range to 8.7-fold more than the predicted normal weight (normal is 2.5% of body weight), with a median of 1.75%.\n",
      "Hepatic glucocerebroside levels are elevated from 23-fold to 389-fold above the reference range.\n",
      "The massively enlarged liver is usually firm to palpation, with an irregular surface. Cirrhosis and portal hypertension are uncommon but occur in a small number of patients with Gaucher disease. Compression of the sinusoids by Gaucher cells can accentuate portal hypertension.\n",
      "Death from variceal bleeding has been reported, especially prior to enzyme replacement therapy. Minor elevations of liver enzyme levels are common, even in patients who are mildly affected, but the presence of jaundice or impaired hepatocellular synthetic function is a poor prognostic indicator. Jaundice in a patient with Gaucher disease is usually a result of infection, the development of chronic hepatitis, or, rarely, hepatic decompensation in the late stages. The presence of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia is more suggestive of hemolysis. \n",
      "Elevated levels of serum ferritin are occasionally found in individuals with Gaucher disease; however, transferrin saturation is usually normal. Glycolipid-laden Gaucher cells are evident in the sinusoids on liver biopsy findings, but the hepatocytes do not manifest overt glycolipid storage, presumably because of biliary excretion of glucocerebroside and the fact that exogenous glycolipid turnover is handled by the mononuclear phagocytes. Sparing of hepatocytes is consistent with the low incidence of liver failure in individuals with Gaucher disease. \n",
      "Skeletal manifestations of Gaucher disease vary, ranging from asymptomatic Erlenmeyer flask deformity of the distal femora to pathologic fractures, vertebral collapse, and acute bone crises that can be confused with acute osteomyelitis.\n",
      "Painful bone crises result from episodes of bone infarction, leading to osteosclerosis analogous to that occurring in sickle cell disease. \n",
      "In children with Gaucher disease, acute hip lesions can be misinterpreted as Legg-Calvé-Perthes disease, and avascular necrosis of the hips is a common complication in individuals of all ages. \n",
      "Hematologic manifestations of Gaucher disease include cytopenia and acquired coagulopathy due to factor XI deficiency. However, genetic factor XI deficiency is common in individuals of Ashkenazi descent and may be present in some patients with Gaucher disease.\n",
      "Cytopenia that develops in patients who have undergone splenectomy reflects advanced marrow infiltration by Gaucher cells. Bone marrow failure and myelofibrosis occur in a small number of these patients. \n",
      "Numerous immunologic abnormalities are common in individuals with Gaucher disease, including hypergammaglobulinemia, T-lymphocyte deficiency in the spleen, and impaired neutrophil chemotaxis. \n",
      "All 3 forms of Gaucher disease are caused by glucocerebrosidase activity deficiency due to mutations in GBA1, the structural gene that encodes the enzyme. Widespread accumulation of glucosylceramide-laden macrophages results from the enzyme deficiency. \n",
      "More than 300 different mutant GBA1 alleles have been identified in patients with Gaucher disease. Screening for the 6 most common GBA1 mutations in patients of Ashkenazi Jewish descent has enabled the identification of 90%-95% of the mutant alleles in this population, but a large number of other mutations have been described in other populations, making screening impractical. \n",
      "Some mutations derive from recombination with the glucocerebrosidase pseudogene, a sequence 15 kb downstream that shares 96% sequence homology to glucocerebrosidase. Complex alleles with regions of pseudogene sequence, in which simple polymerase chain reaction (PCR)–based mutation detection screening is inadequate, have been identified in some patients. \n",
      "Genotype and phenotype correlations have been noted in some specific Gaucher presentations. For example, patients with type 1 Gaucher disease who are homozygous for the N370S mutation tend to have a later onset and a relatively mild course, and patients with type 3 Gaucher disease who are homozygous for the D409H mutation exhibit a rare phenotype that involves cardiac calcifications, oculomotor abnormalities, and corneal opacities. However, clinical presentation in patients with Gaucher disease widely varies and frequently cannot be fully explained by the underlying mutations because severity can vary even among siblings who have identical genotypes. \n",
      "Similarly, the amount of residual enzymatic activity does not accurately predict disease subtype and severity, with the exception that many of the mutations identified in patients with severe type 2 Gaucher disease express little, if any, enzymatic activity in vitro. These are frequently nonsense, frame-shift, or recombinant alleles that cannot form a complete protein and are essentially null alleles. \n",
      "Multiple myeloma\n",
      "Parkinson disease: This is more common in patients with Gaucher disease and GBA1 mutation carriers. Subjects with Parkinson disease are more than 5 times more likely to have a mutation in the glucocerebrosidase gene.[4, 5] \n",
      "Lewy body dementia: Patients with Lewy body dementia are also far more likely to carry a mutation in GBA1.[6] \n",
      "Diagnosis can be confirmed through measurement of glucocerebrosidase activity in peripheral blood leukocytes. A finding of less than 15% of mean normal activity is diagnostic. Heterozygotes generally have half-normal enzyme activity, but as much as 20% overlap with activity levels of healthy controls has been reported, rendering enzymatic testing for carrier status unreliable. \n",
      "Molecular diagnosis can be helpful, especially in Ashkenazi patients, in whom 6 GBA1 mutations (ie, N370S, c.84insG, L444P, IVS2+1g>a, V394L, and R496H) account for most disease alleles. In other ethnicities, sequencing of the exons of GBA1 is necessary in order to accurately establish the genotype. Mutation analysis has some, albeit limited, predictive value with respect to disease progression. Caution should be taken in relying solely on PCR-based test results for individual mutations because they cannot reveal the presence of recombinant alleles associated with greater disease severity. \n",
      "Obtain CBC count and differential to assess the degree of cytopenia. \n",
      "Minor elevations of liver enzyme levels are common, even in patients who are mildly affected with Gaucher disease; however, the presence of jaundice or impaired hepatocellular synthetic function merits a full hepatic evaluation. Coagulations studies should be monitored. \n",
      "Angiotensin-converting enzyme levels are typically elevated, as are total acid phosphatase and ferritin levels. Monitoring levels of another enzyme, chitotriosidase, is also useful in monitoring the disease, except in the 10% of the population who have a deficiency in this protein. \n",
      "Ultrasonography of the abdomen can reveal the extent of organomegaly. MRI is more accurate than ultrasonography in determining organ size. Hip MRI may be useful in revealing early avascular necrosis. MRI may be useful in delineating the degree of marrow infiltration and evaluating spinal involvement. Skeletal radiography can be used to detect and evaluate skeletal manifestations of Gaucher disease. Perform chest radiography to evaluate pulmonary manifestations. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) is useful in evaluating osteopenia. \n",
      "Echocardiograms are helpful in evaluating the possibility of pulmonary hypertension.\n",
      "In neurononpathic Gaucher disease, EEG, brainstem-evoked potential, swallow studies, and neuro-ophthalmalogic evaluation should be performed at regular intervals. \n",
      "In the past, the diagnosis was confirmed with the finding of classic glycolipid-laden macrophages in bone marrow aspirate collected because of hematological abnormalities; however, aspiration is not a recommended diagnostic tool. Similar pseudo-Gaucher cells have also been described in individuals with other disorders, including chronic granulocytic leukemia, thalassemia, multiple myeloma, Hodgkin disease, plasmacytoid lymphomas, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and Mycobacterium avium– intracellulare infection. \n",
      "Bone marrow aspiration should not be the initial diagnostic test because the blood enzyme test is sensitive, specific, and much less invasive. \n",
      "Liver biopsy is occasionally performed to assess unexplained hepatomegaly. It can be avoided in most patients when the diagnosis is suspected because a specific diagnostic test is available. \n",
      "In Gaucher disease, classic glycolipid-laden macrophages are found in bone marrow aspirate or in liver biopsy samples. On liver biopsy samples, glycolipid-laden Gaucher cells are evident in the sinusoids, but the hepatocytes do not manifest overt glycolipid storage, presumably because of biliary excretion of glucocerebroside and because exogenous glycolipid turnover is handled by the mononuclear phagocytes. The sparing of hepatocytes is consistent with the low incidence of liver failure in individuals with Gaucher disease. \n",
      "The pathologic hallmark of Gaucher disease is the presence of Gaucher cells in the macrophage-monocyte system, particularly in the bone marrow. These cells, which are 20-100 mm in diameter, have a characteristic wrinkled-paper appearance, resulting from intracytoplasmic substrate deposition, and stain strongly positive with periodic acid–Schiff. Histologic evaluation of biopsy specimens should not be used as a first-line diagnostic tool. \n",
      "Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for type 1 Gaucher disease includes imiglucerase (Cerezyme), velaglucerase alfa (VPRIV), and taliglucerase alfa (Elelyso). Historically, most patients received the recombinant enzyme imiglucerase.[7] This preparation is highly effective in reversing the visceral and hematologic manifestations of Gaucher disease. However, skeletal disease is slow to respond, and pulmonary involvement is relatively resistant to the enzyme. Treatment is typically administered once every other week at a high dose, but, in some patients, treatment is administered every week at a medium dose or as many as 3 times per week at low doses. Good responses have been described with all dose regimens, and the issue of the most suitable initial and maintenance dosages remains controversial. \n",
      "ERT is indicated for patients with type 1 Gaucher disease who exhibit clinical signs and symptoms of the disease, including anemia, thrombocytopenia, skeletal disease, or visceromegaly. Severity and rate of disease progression widely varies, especially in adults, which makes treatment decisions extremely difficult in some patients. Generally, children who present symptomatically, rather than because of family history, may have severe disease manifestations that require early treatment. Presymptomatic treatment with ERT remains controversial because of the lack of prognostic correlation between genotype and disease severity and the high cost of the therapy. \n",
      "For most patients with Gaucher disease in the United States, treatment with ERT is typically guided by a geneticist or a hematologist. Patients should receive periodic follow-up at a center familiar with Gaucher disease, if possible. \n",
      "ERT has a remarkable effect on hepatosplenomegaly, with an average overall decrease of 25% in liver and spleen volume after 6 months of therapy. In most patients with anemia, hemoglobin levels rise by 1.5 g/dL during the first 4-6 months of therapy. An additional increase of 1 g/dL is observed in the subsequent 9-18 months in patients with persistent anemia. The platelet count responds more slowly, doubling on average over 1 year. The hematologic status of patients with splenomegaly must be closely monitored, and splenectomy is still occasionally necessary. \n",
      "Skeletal disease is the slowest to respond, with symptomatic improvement described by some within the first year of treatment, although a much longer period of ERT is required to achieve a radiologic response. Patients with bone crises require pain relief, hydration, and close monitoring. A bone scan is sometimes needed to differentiate between a bone crisis and infection.\n",
      "Other effects of ERT in children with Gaucher disease include an increased growth velocity, weight gain, increased energy levels, and a correction of both delayed puberty and hypermetabolic state.\n",
      "The response of patients to ERT widely varies and does not correlate with genotype, disease severity, splenectomy, or age. However, a number of factors, including cirrhosis and portal hypertension, extensive infarction and fibrosis of the spleen, and lung involvement, portend a poor response to therapy. \n",
      "The symptoms of patients with Gaucher disease who have associated hematologic malignancies respond relatively poorly to ERT. To overcome these difficulties, increased dosage and frequency of enzyme infusions have been attempted. The symptoms of patients with decompensated liver disease do not appear to respond well to ERT, and these patients remain at risk for life-threatening hemorrhage due to variceal bleeding. \n",
      "No evidence shows that ERT results in neurologic improvement. Although the enzyme affects the visceral involvement in types 2 and 3 disease, the associated brain involvement may persist or progress. \n",
      "Glucosylceramide synthase inhibitors include miglustat (Zavesca) and eliglustat (Cerdelga). Miglustat was approved in 2003 as monotherapy for treatment of adults with mild-to-moderate type 1 Gaucher disease for whom enzyme replacement therapy is not a therapeutic option. \n",
      "Eliglustat was approved in August 2014 as first-line treatment for the long-term treatment of adults with Gaucher disease type 1. The dose of eliglustat is determined by establishing the patient’s CYP2D6 phenotype (ie, extensive metabolizers [EM], intermediate metabolizers [IM], or poor metabolizers [PM]). \n",
      "Approval was based on efficacy data from 2 positive phase 3 studies involving 199 patients. One study involved patients new to therapy (trial 1), and the other involved patients switching from approved enzyme replacement therapies (trial 2). Efficacy data from 4 years of the Cerdelga phase 2 study also contributed to the approval. Improvements in study participants were observed in spleen size, platelet levels, hemoglobin levels, and liver volume, and noninferiority to enzyme replacement therapy (imiglucerase) was established in trial 2.[8, 9] \n",
      "Partial and total splenectomy was once advocated in the treatment of patients with Gaucher disease. However, with the availability of ERT, this procedure is no longer necessary in most patients. \n",
      "In addition, patients with Gaucher disease may require hip replacements or other orthopedic procedures to treat skeletal disease. This is best undertaken after the patient has undergone several months of ERT. \n",
      "Consultations with the following specialists are indicated:\n",
      "Medical geneticist\n",
      "Hematologist\n",
      "Orthopedist\n",
      "Neurologist\n",
      "Neuro-ophthalmologist\n",
      "No dietary manipulation has been found to affect disease progression.\n",
      "Patients with massive splenomegaly or severe thrombocytopenia should avoid contact sports and any other activities that place them at risk for splenic rupture or bleeding. \n",
      "Several therapies have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of type 1 Gaucher disease. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with glucocerebrosidase purified from human placenta was FDA approved in 1991, followed by approval in 1994 of a recombinant form of the enzyme produced in cultured Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, marketed as imiglucerase (Cerezyme). Worldwide, over 4,000 patients with Gaucher disease have received ERT, which is safe and well tolerated. \n",
      "In 2010, an alternate form of ERT was approved. This form of recombinant enzyme is produced in cultured human cells and is marketed as velaglucerase alfa (VPRIV).[10, 11] In May 2012, taliglucerase alfa (Elelyso) was the first plant cell–based ERT approved by the FDA; it uses engineered carrot cells.[12] \n",
      "The glucosylceramide synthase inhibitors, miglustat and eliglustat, were approved for adults with type 1 Gaucher disease in 2003 and 2014 respectively.\n",
      "Approximately 10-15% of patients with Gaucher disease treated with imiglucerase develop antibodies to the enzyme protein, but few develop any significant allergic reactions, which are controlled with premedication with hydrocortisone, antihistamines, or both. All antibodies have immunoglobulin G (IgG), mostly of the IgG1 subclass. A few patients with Gaucher disease have developed antibodies that impair enzyme activity. \n",
      "In most cases, ERT is highly effective in reversing the visceral and hematologic manifestations of type 1 Gaucher disease. Recombinant beta-glucocerebrosidase (imiglucerase [Cerezyme]) has replaced the original tissue-derived product, alglucerase (Ceredase). Alglucerase is an orphan drug and still manufactured by Genzyme Corporation on an extremely limited basis for a few patients unable to tolerate the newer recombinant product. Presymptomatic use is controversial because of the high cost and the extremely variable clinical course. \n",
      "Imiglucerase is approved for children aged 2 years or older. Velaglucerase and taliglucerase are both approved for children aged 4 years or older. \n",
      "A recombinant-derived analog of beta-glucocerebrosidase produced in mammalian cell culture and chemically modified by mannose termination of glycosylated amino acids. Catalyzes hydrolytic cleavage of glucocerebroside (a glycoprotein) to glucose and ceramide within the lysosomes of phagocytic cells in the reticuloendothelial system. Treatment with recombinant enzyme improves anemia and thrombocytopenia, reduces spleen and liver size, and decreases cachexia \n",
      "Hydrolytic lysosomal glucocerebroside-specific enzyme indicated for long-term enzyme replacement therapy for type 1 Gaucher disease. Improves symptoms associated with the disease, including anemia, thrombocytopenia, increased spleen and liver size, and cachexia. \n",
      "Taliglucerase is a plant-based recombinant enzyme. It catalyzes the hydrolysis of glucocerebroside to glucose and ceramide, which results in reduced spleen and liver enlargement and increased RBCs and platelets. \n",
      "These agents inhibit the enzyme glucosylceramide synthase, the initial enzyme in a series of reactions that result in the synthesis of most glycosphingolipids, including glucocerebroside. The goal of treatment is to reduce the rate of glucocerebroside biosynthesis so that the amount is reduced to a level that allows the residual activity of the deficient glucocerebrosidase enzyme to be more effective (substrate reduction therapy). \n",
      "Indicated for type 1 Gaucher disease in patients in whom ERT is not a therapeutic option. Reduces GSL production by inhibiting glucosylceramide synthase. Reduces spleen and liver volume and increases hemoglobin and platelet counts. \n",
      "Eliglustat is a specific inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase, thereby reducing production of glucosylceramide. It is indicated for the long-term treatment of adults with Gaucher disease type 1 who are CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers (EM), intermediate metabolizers (IM), or poor metabolizers (PM) as detected by an FDA-cleared test for phenotype. Dosage is based on establishing the patient's CYP2D6 metabolizer status. \n",
      "Most symptomatic patients with Gaucher disease receive enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), which is provided on an outpatient basis.[13] Monitoring for allergic reactions is essential. \n",
      "Monitoring patients who receive miglustat (Zavesca) every 6 months for possible development of peripheral neuropathy is recommended.\n",
      "Patients with osteoporosis have responded favorably to bisphosphonates.\n",
      "Patients with Gaucher disease who have bone crises may require admission for pain relief. Patients with severe hematologic manifestations may have episodes of bleeding that require inpatient treatment. \n",
      "Gaucher disease is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. Although it is panethnic, Gaucher disease is more common in individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish. Although carrier-screening programs in this population have been established at some centers to identify couples at risk for having a child affected with Gaucher disease, testing must be offered in conjunction with genetic counseling to provide couples at risk, even asymptomatic individuals, with a description of the range of associated phenotypes and their options, which include prenatal diagnosis. \n",
      "Newborn screening is not performed for Gaucher disease.\n",
      "Bone crises may occur secondarily to infarcts. Avascular necrosis of the hip is not uncommon. \n",
      "Splenic rupture can result from trauma.\n",
      "Cirrhosis is a rare complication.\n",
      "Rarely, pulmonary infiltration by Gaucher cells may manifest as overt lung disease, which may present as pulmonary infiltrates and lung consolidation; this pattern is especially common in patients with type 2 disease. \n",
      "Parenchymal infiltration with fibrosis has been described in children with type 3 disease.\n",
      "Intrapulmonary vascular dilatation in the presence or absence of portal hypertension has also been described in some patients with Gaucher disease, resulting in hypoxic lung disease. \n",
      "Adult patients with pulmonary hypertension in the absence of infiltrative disease have been described; these patients may follow an inexorable progressive course despite therapy. \n",
      "Hematologic abnormalities, including anemia, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia, are common in individuals with Gaucher disease\n",
      "Immunologic abnormalities, including hypergammaglobulinemia, T-lymphocyte deficiency in the spleen, and impaired neutrophil chemotaxis, are also common. The malignancy multiple myeloma is more common in individuals with Gaucher disease. \n",
      "New evidence suggests that mutations in the gene for glucocerebrosidase are a risk factor for the development of Parkinson disease.[14, 15] Of subjects with Parkinson disease and related Lewy body disorders, 3-20% carry a mutation in glucocerebrosidase, with the higher frequency being among Ashkenazi Jewish subjects.[13] \n",
      "Many individuals with Gaucher disease have few manifestations and a normal life expectancy without any intervention.\n",
      "The prognosis for symptomatic patients with type 1 or type 3 Gaucher disease who receive treatment is very good, with a decrease in organomegaly and an eventual rise in hemoglobin levels and platelet counts. \n",
      "A recent study estimated life expectancy at birth in patients with type 1 Gaucher disease to be 68 years, compared with 77 years in the reference population.[16] \n",
      "Skeletal disease is slow to respond to ERT and widely varies.\n",
      "Some patients describe symptomatic improvement within the first year of treatment, although a much longer period of ERT is required to achieve a radiologic response. \n",
      "Patients with Gaucher disease and their families require education regarding the disease manifestations, variability in symptoms and disease progression, and potential complications. In addition, they should be counseled regarding the genetic risks \n",
